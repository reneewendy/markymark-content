## Your Help Requested : 
- [482 drafts are in the queue!](https://github.com/reneewendy/nascent-content/tree/main/content/drafts)
- Edit drafts to adapt to Jinja & Markdown

A lot was already accomplished with shell tools. The remaining work needs a human eye.  Article text must be at the bottom, with two blank lines above it.  Also each file needs miscellaneous clean-up and judgement calls, merging duplicates (e.g. authors) or deleting duplicates (e.g. titles). In particular, eyeball the image tags. Contact Wendy for guidance!
