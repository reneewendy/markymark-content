<h3>Maryland Has A Snake Problem #1</h3>
<p>
(Maryland) A homeowner in Montgomery County was fed up
with a snake infestation. But instead of calling a professional they opted
to smoke the basement with burning coals on the basement floor! The coals
started a fire that <em>likely did smoke out snakes, but it also spread</em> and
burned that house to the ground! Like bringing a chainsaw to a knife
fight. There were no (human) injuries, so this one's an Honorable
Mention--but check out the next:

<h3>Maryland Has A Snake Problem #2</h3>
<p>
On January 19, 2022, authorities making a 'welfare check' in Pomfret, MD
found David Riston dead alone in their house--alone except for numerous
species of snakes, some venomous! Cobras, rattlesnakes, black mambas, and a
gigantic python were among the 124 serpentine residents still living in the
house. These exotic snakes were kept in beautiful habitat enclosures, but
evidently one disgruntled <em>Serpente</em> had protested confinement:
Autopsy confirmed that the 49-year-old <em>Homo sapiens</em> died of
'accidental' snake envenomation.

Accidental? Did anyone ask the snake about its motives? Also I found no
report on <strong>which species</strong> did it. I sense a parlor mystery
game here... The body was discovered on January 19, 2022 and (snort)
NEIGHBORS&nbsp;HAD&nbsp;NO&nbsp;IDEA!
