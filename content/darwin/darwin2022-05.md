(Italy) No water shortage in this Italian supermarket, where
a sudden tidal wave of water spelled doom for a ransacker. The man, 46,
was a well known character in the city of Cattolica. He snuck into the
back of the closed market on Easter Monday&mdash;and that break-in was his
last.

He paused to enjoy a drink of water, pulling a bottle from a towering
tableau, and the whole darned stack collapsed on top of him like a tidal
wave! Employees returned to the shop the next day, and were confronted by
a collapsed mess of crates.

A few hours into the workday they finally began to sort the collapse

stack. Lifting the first crate, an arm emerged! It was immediately clear
that a tragedy had taken place. But what...?

Thanks to the CCTV footage, the <em>carabinieri</em> were able to
reconstruct the last moments of the 46-year-old's life as he tugged the
bottle free, and was crushed by the weight of the crates. People were sad
he had died, but then again it was twice his fault: breaking in,
and&nbsp;alone in the store&nbsp;taunting gravity to do its worst.
