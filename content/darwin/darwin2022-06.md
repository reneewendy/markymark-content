<p><em><strong>Driver wins a slow-roll Darwin Award</strong></em>

(California) Perplexing. Why did a Las Vegas resident jump
out of the car inside an Escondido car wash at midnight? Avoiding a bee?
All we know is, they did.

Rene Tactay drove into the carwash, then EXITED the Scion hatchback (!!)
while the drive was still IN GEAR. (!?) Under its own power, the Scion
evidently crept forward as cars do, and the 56-year-old was pinned beneath
the vehicle. Escondido police said, "The carwash was not active at the
time."
