(Ukraine) You are wearing body armor in a warzone. You spot abandoned Macbook. You
want Macbook. Where to hide it? With quick reflexes a Russian soldier
slid that Macbook into his chest armor pocket, replacing a ballistic plate
designed to save his life.
<P>
He was killed in Irpin, and his body was retrieved, providing a hearty
laugh for all of Ukraine. 'Instant Karma' They reportedly found a stolen
iPad as well. Wonder where the iPad was
hidden? <span class="smalltext">Next to <em>this watch?</em> (Pulp Fiction)</span>
