(10 March 2007, Scotland) James, 26, was working on a new house when,
according to early reports, "The operative picked up [a cannister of
insulating foam] and gave it a shake as recommended. A pressure explosion
occurred when the can burst.) The bottom section hit him on the chest
[and] crumpled and wrinkled to some six inches, resulting in his death."

Because of this misleading initial report, a safety alert was issued,
warning of the potential for cans of expanding foam to undergo lethal
decompression.	But the warning was retracted when it was discovered that
James had, for reasons unknown, <I>applied a blowtorch</I> to the
pressurized 500-ml cannister, <!-- James Thomson --> causing the lethal
malfunction.

Darwin notes, <I>"This event is tentatively confirmed.	A legitimate
newspaper states that a man died from an exploding can of insulation. But
the detail that he was using a blowtorch was gleaned from an eyewitness
account, and a statement attributed to the <A

manufacturer.</A>"</I>
