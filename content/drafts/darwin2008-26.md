(30 October 2008, Oklahoma) Peter G., 32, was an accomplished big cat
keeper.	 With his huge heart and gift of connecting with animals, this
former Tulsa Zoo keeper was the perfect volunteer at Safari's Animal
Sanctuary in Broken Arrow. Perfect until the liger incident.

You may ask, as we asked, "What's a liger?"

Ligers are unusual animals, a sterile cross between a male lion and a
female tiger, and (like mules) not a species in their own right. Although
a liger is a evolutionary dead end, this powerful hybrid is the largest of
cats. Rocky, the liger that lived in Broken Arrow, was known as a big
baby--but he was not a domestic animal.	 The wildlife sanctuary manager
said, "In all my years we've stressed that whatever you do, don't open that
gate."

Peter opened that gate.

For reasons unknown, he violated the rules and entered the liger cage
during feeding time, only to become an appetizer for the hungry carnivore.
Although he dragged himself out of the cage before becoming the main
course, he died in the hospital that very night.

Peter was loved, and he will be missed, but he well aware of the dangers
posed by captive wild animals.	By not following very obvious safety rules,
Peter was behaving with all the care and caution typical of a Darwin Award
winner.	 Burp.
