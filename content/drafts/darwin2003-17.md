(September 7, 2003, Cambodia) Khim, nicknamed "The Big Giant," was an
intimidatingly large former military policeman when he arrived at the Phnom
Penh home of a drug dealer to extort money and amphetamines. He was a much
smaller man soon afterwards.

He pulled the pin from a grenade to threaten the dealer, who immediately
decided to give him the items he demanded. Then Khim, who had been
drinking, forgot to put the pin back before slipping the grenade into his
pocket. He walked to his motorbike, well satisfied with the transaction. As
he climbed aboard... the grenade exploded.

Whether the drug dealer recovered his cash (and in what condition!) is
unknown.

<B>Reader Darren</B> says, "Returning the pin to a grenade will not render
it inert, once triggered; no fuse-mechanism will halt until it is blown
from the grenade. Returning a pin to a 'thrown' (or otherwise triggered)
grenade is a losing proposition. I think our bandit, a military-police
officer, remembered the pin, but skipped basic-instruction.<BR> <A

<P>While it is true that once the ignition sequence has begun it
cannot be stopped, that has nothing to do with the ring. The ring is a
safety which retains the spoon. Once the spoon has been released,
<I>then</I> the grenade is active.

<P>The actual trigger is a small hammer held down by the "spoon" ...
modern grenades worldwide have some variation of this.	What most
likely happened is that the moment the awardee put it in his pocket,
he released the spoon, setting off the trigger.

<P>I am an Ammo-Tech currently serving in the military and I receive
grenades without the pin and tape wrapped around the spoon on a
regular basis.	The grenade is not activated until the spoon is
released.

<P>Are you happy to see me, or is that a grenade in your pocket?
