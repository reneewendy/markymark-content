(30 April 2009, York, United Kingdom) In another do-it-yourself project
gone wrong, a 41-year-old homeowner attempting to demolish a large brick
garden shed succeeded in his primary objective, but suffered collateral
damage when the cement slab roof demolished him.

The unfortunate chap was alone on his property at the time. While one has
to question the wisdom of undertaking a demolition project with no-one on
hand in the event of a mishap, a neighbor happened to witness this 'mishap'
and immediately summoned help.	Hydraulic rams and high pressure air bags
were too late to stop fate. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene.

In the unequal contest between flesh and stone, the stone always wins.
