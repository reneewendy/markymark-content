(15 December 2009, Germany) A U2 subway driver found a body laying besides
the underground tracks in Berlin. Because there was no video surveillance
camera at that location, it took police two days to reconstruct what had
happened. Apparently Yasin A., 22, was alone in the subway car when he
decided it would be a brilliant idea to destroy one of the windows. By
swinging feet forward from a handrail into the window, he not only managed
to burst the glass but also succeeded in being sucked out of the moving
train, and was left dead on the tracks. He was alone in the compartment at
the time; if an observer had been present, perhaps the young underground
rider would not have engaged in destructive nonsense that led to his
senseless death.
