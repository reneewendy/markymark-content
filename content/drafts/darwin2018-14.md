(27 Nov 2018, Arizona) The Buckeye Police
Department reports that a man accidentally shot his own sausage while
shopping in the meat aisle at Walmart. Arizona law does not require a
permit (nor a holster for that matter) to carry a firearm, so our hero felt
free to carry his piece "commando-style" (unholstered) beneath his
waistband. When the unholstered gun drifted down into his jeans, he reached
in and pulled the trigger while repositioning his weapon. This loose
cannon's low hanging fruit didn&#8217;t have a chance. Firearm supporters
can add this event to the arsenal of ammunition against gun control. Guns
really do make a difference.

Darwin Award? Odds are, our gun nut (pun intended) shredded his ability to breed and
wins the uncommon Living Darwin Award: still alive but unable to
reproduce. Otherwise, his reward is an Honorable Mention -- "better luck
next time." We await further information.
