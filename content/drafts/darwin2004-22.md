jinja-title: Bannister to Heaven


jinja-confirmed:
jinja-status: draft
(20 July 2004, Florida) The Kleman Plaza parking garage in Tallahassee has
the ideal bannister for a long slide, spiraling around an open stairwell
all the way down from the fifth floor without a break.	Brian, 24, was a
real-life hero who had saved a friend from drowning, but friends said he
was also a "big fan of reality TV and high-risk stunts." The bannister was
his big chance!

But just sliding down a 5-story the bannister was nowhere near risky enough
for Brian, so he planned to leap onto the bannister to begin his slide.	 He
ran, he jumped... and he sailed completely over it, plunging 52 feet to the
bottom of the stairwell. A friend fondly reminisced that "Brian had done
crazier things than this" before. But this was Brian's first stunt
spectacular enough to win a Darwin Award.

According to a police investigation, "alcohol may have been a factor."
