<!-- 6.4 / 10 (322) edit Feb 2009, kept vote -->

(13 August 2009, Quebec, Canada) A 24-year-old woman was ironically
successful in her attempt to catch a bus in Quebec City. Clutching a can
of pop, the woman ran into a restricted area and tried to flag down 45-foot
bus that had left on time--without her. As she tried her best to get
herself noticed, she herself failed to notice that the bus was making a
swift turn in her direction.

A veteran driver said that drivers cannot hear anything over the sound of
their engines.

The woman was disappeared beneath the wheels of the turning bus. It was
obvious to a former nurse, who rushed to her aid, that she was no longer
able to concern herself with getting there on time. Instead of riding home
in a crowded bus, the deceased woman enjoyed the luxury of a free, one-way
trip "home" in a private hearse.

Considering that you have to do something really stupid to get squished by
a bus in a transit center--such as sneaking into a restricted area and
running under the tires--the bus company said it does not plan to increase
security. <!-- A spokesperson said the woman should never have been in the
parking lot. -->
