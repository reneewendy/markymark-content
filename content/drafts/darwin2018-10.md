(22 July 2018, New South Wales AU) The ban on shopping bags has taken a
terrible toll. A 58-year-old woman was run over by her Mazda CX7 after she
pulled over to check whether the grocery bags were in the trunk. The car,
evidently not secured by the parking brake, ambled backwards along
Ambleside Drive in Castle Hill and killed the wee woman. A little mistake,
a mere bagatelle, caused such a tragedy! News reports failed to reveal
whether shopping bags were, in fact, inside the vehicle.
