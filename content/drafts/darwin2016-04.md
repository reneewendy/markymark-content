(7 June 2016, Wyoming) Colin Mathaniel Scott, 23, was enjoying a graduation
vacation at Yellowstone National Park when the
beautiful <A href="http://www.yellowstonepark.com/norris-back-basin-geysers/">Porkchop
Geyser</A> hot spring reminded him that he could use a good soak! But
"hot-potting" is a forbidden delight, ruled off-limits for good
reason: <B>You will die.</B>

Still, this was a college graduation trip. The Portland resident thought
his edjumacation conferred the smarts to know when to break a rule. So
Colin left the boardwalk and cruised up a hill in search of a private
<I>hot-pot soaking spot.</I> In this area of the park, thin mineral crusts
that resemble solid ground conceal scalding water pools! But he avoided
these unseen pitfalls and found a secluded spring.

Recorded on unreleased video, Colin is seen reaching down to check the temperature, slipping, and falling into the boiling acidic water. That was the beginning of the end.

Chemistry students will be familiar with the properties of a turbulent hot
acid solution. A significant amount of rapid dissolving was underway while
recovery workers were struggling
with <A href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/norrisplan.htm">dangerously
unstable ground</A> and a lightning storm. When they reached the spring
the next day, the water had finished her work. There were no remains
remaining! Only <A href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/man-fell-yellowstone-hot-spring-completely-dissolved-day/">a wallet and flip-flops</A> were left of poor Colin.

Park Superintendent Dan Wenk stated the obvious, "This tragic event must
remind all of us to follow the regulations." College graduates are no
exception. The Darwin Awards sincerely hopes this misadventure will serve
as a warning to others -- <B>#YourDeathMatters</B>
