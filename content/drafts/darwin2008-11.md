(8 March 2008, Florida) Just because you see it online does not mean it's a
good idea. Cameron, 18, was joyriding in a shopping cart as he held onto a
moving SUV. An eyewitness said, "It's irresponsible behavior, but what do
you expect from kids?"	The car and the cart went over a speed bump and the
cart overturned, ejecting its occupant, who was not wearing the little seat
belt. Cameron was pronounced dead at the scene.
