The ambulance responded to a frantic call concerning a neighbor's trip
through an industrial tree shredder. It seems the individual had decided to
prune his own trees, rather than hire a professional. Why not? After all,
the local shop rented shredders that could make quick work of yard debris,
including tree limbs up to 8 inches in diameter.

To save time (those fateful words) the neighbor had placed the shredder at
the base of a great oak tree, where he could drop branches directly into
the hopper. He intended to cut off the top third of the oak, since it had
been killed by lightning.

With the shredder running wide open, the neighbor climbed his ladder to the
first tree branch, stepped off the ladder, slipped, and fell. The
paramedics found him very dead, half in and half out of the shredder's
hopper, one leg shredded to the hip.

Not married, no kids, removed self from the gene pool.
