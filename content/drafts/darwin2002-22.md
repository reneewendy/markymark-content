(July 2002, Romania) Forget posted train schedules! Like an American Indian
listening for horses in an old Western, a Romanian man placed his ear
against the tracks to listen for the arrival of a train scheduled to stop
at his station. Instead, the 46-year-old man was hit by an express train,
and died instantly from head trauma. <!-- Vasile Alexa --><BR>
Apparently it's true that you don't hear the bullet that hits you!
