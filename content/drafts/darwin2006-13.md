(28 July 2006, Australia) Police wished to question Gareth, 38, in
connection with a stabbing. But he evaded that unpleasant business by
driving his car into a power pole. It was initially assumed that he had
simply lost control of the vehicle, but Victoria police soon determined
that the fatal crash was caused by an accidental shot to the groin.
Apparently the deceased had been driving along with a loaded firearm that
he kept handy in the footwell of the car.
