<A href="/art/banwell/" target="_top"><IMG src="/i/art/banwell/darwin2000-12.gif" width="180" height="324" align="right" border="0"></A>(13 March 2000, New Jersey) It started out like a scene from The Brady Bunch. Andrew and his fianc&eacute;e were living together with his three children and her three children in Dover Township, when an argument over chocolate cake icing erupted. </P>
	 <P align="left">
Andrew accused his ten-year-old son of taking the missing container, and the two became embroiled in a heated disagreement. Andrew took the boy out to the garage for a private discussion, and there the conversation became even more emotional. Then the man made his fatal mistake.</P>
	 <P align="left">He handed a five-inch kitchen knife to his angry son, and challenged the boy to stab him if he hated him so much. The boy put the knife down, but Andrew picked it up and placed it in his hand again. In the heat of the moment the outraged boy took him up on the offer and plunged the knife into his chest. The deadly blow happened so fast that no one could stop it.</P>
	 <P align="left">Andrew was pronounced dead at Community Medical Center. His last words were &quot;Would you believe the kid did that?&quot;</P>
	 <P align="left">The fourth grader, charged with manslaughter and illegal possession of a weapon, faces up to three years imprisonment. But Ocean County prosecutor E. David Millard said it was unlikely that he would serve jail time, as the boy had been provoked.

<B>This is a classic Darwin. </B>The man will no longer reproduce, and his son obviously had better genes for survival than his father-his mother's contribution, plus the more robust half of his father's genes. Although a man who could inspire such rage in a child is not a sympathetic figure, it is unfortunate that his son was traumatized.

Icing on the cake... blood sugar blowout. The sugar of the missing icing may have contributed to the "rush" of events.

let's leave out stupidity and emotional abuse at a child's expense. Apparently, the asshole had it coming if he could inspire that much rage in a little boy....but it's not funny. not even morbidly funny.<BR>

This is classic Darwin. That man will no longer reproduce. His son obviously had better genes for survival than his father (his mother's contribution, plus the more robust half of his father's genes), and so only the fathers good genes survive. The gene pool is strengthened, and humanity will benefit. <BR>

I have to agree with Heather. It's funny on the surface, but once you dig a little, it's just plain disturbing. Sonofabitch deserved to die. The boy obviously needs counseling more than a stay in prison.<BR>

Charge him with manslaughter??? No way! Congratulate him for helping rid the planet of bad genes. Set him free so that he can attend the 2000 Darwin Awards Banquet, and accept his late father's trophy.<BR>

You're missing the point, Heather. This has nothing to do with whether or not what happened is funny (its not). The issue is whether or not the father "Improved our gene pool by being too stupid to live or retain the ability to contribute to the gene pool," as stated in the Darwin Rules. This gentleman is a legitimate contender. Its too bad that his son will be mentally scarred because of this. However, every person who wins a Darwin award has friends and family members that are saddened or traumatized by their loss. That doesn't lessen their contribution to human evolution. <BR>

I'm not convinced this story can be true, as I'm sure it requires some strength to force a knife through somebody's chest. Well, at least the breast plate anyway. Would a 10 yr old have been strong enough?<BR>

You are no anatomical genius, Ruxpin. Nothing says you have to drive it through the breastplate. Between 2 ribs can be just as lethal, and is very easy to do. And a very pissed off 10 year old could penetrate the brestplate. <BR>

Believe me some 10 year olds are very strong... I worked as a counselor with 8 and 9 year olds some of whom were 5 feet tall, and quite strong. I don't think this was tragic, I think it was a blessing in disguise.<BR>

I think that the father thought the son loved him, I guess he was wrong. I think its tragic.<BR>

Sounds like The Brady Bunch episode where Peter stabs Mike in the chest. Wait a minute, that wasn't Peter...

i think the father probably took the boy into the shed to threaten him or pick on him. or maybe its something far more disgusting
i reckon he deserved to die, even if he didn't the stupidity of giving a pissed off 10 year old (who i don't think could have really known what he was doing in his state of mind) was sheer stupidity.
its not funny, but it stupid<BR>

I think more people should ask to be eliminated from the gene pool. Why leave it to chance? It was a magnanamous act for this gentleman to help evolution along, rather than wait to be eliminated by a gun, or a snowmobile, or a lobster...<BR>
