(2 February 2008, Italy) David, 46, was sliding down an Italian ski slope one
night, riding on padding that he had removed from the safety barriers at
the bottom of the run. It did not occur to him that it might be dangerous
to sled down the same slope from which he had stolen protective padding.

Sauze d'Oulx is one of five villages that make up the "Milky Way" ski area
in northern Italy. Popular with British skiers, the resort is known
for its party atmosphere. A ski resort spokesperson said,
"The men had all been drinking when they tore off the padding, and ironically..."

...they careened straight into the bare barriers at the bottom of the piste
(groomed slope). David died from head and chest injuries inflicted by the
unpadded metal.	 Two of his friends survived with medical
attention. Another Darwin Award candidate is still missing after he
wandered away "bloodied and distressed." <!-- David Monk, 46 -->
