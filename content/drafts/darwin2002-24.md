jinja-image-alt: "A crumpled sloppy jalopy, hit by a train on the tracks." style="object-fit: scale-down;">

(2 August 2002, Kansas) Death by train is almost too common to merit a
Darwin Award. Very few people are unable to grasp these three important
facts about trains: 1) Trains cannot stop quickly. 2) Trains cannot
swerve. 3) In any collision, the train always wins.

Nevertheless, Jackie Chambers, a43-year-old Olathe man, managed to be
struck and killed by a train after his vehicle broke down on Interstate
35. His attempts to repair his 'sloppy jalopy' had failed, so he stepped
away from the busy freeway to call for help. As luck would have it, he
chose to stand on the train tracks paralleling the road.</p>

<strong><em>When the train engineer spotted Jackie C. standing on the
tracks, he saw a man holding a cell phone to one ear and cupping his hand
to the other ear to block the thundering noise of the oncoming
locomotive!</em></strong> <!-- Jackie L. Chambers Jr., 43 -->

<H3>Music + Trains = Bad&nbsp;Mix&nbsp;Tape</H3>

jinja-sidebar: <p id="sidebar1">
<strong>Authorities are at a loss</strong> as
to how to prevent train deaths. In Long Island, New York, engineers
formed a support group, as every one, without exception, has
involuntarily killed someone. The baffled engineers wonder how
anyone could be unaware that a train weighing hundreds of tons has
too much inertia to stop on a dime -- or even a football
field.

(3 November 2006, Michigan) FACT: In a collision the great mass of a
Train guarantees the Train will win. Forgetting this Captain Obvious Law
Of Physics, a 20-year old man was walking down the railroad tracks in
Comstock Township near Kalamazoo. This, in and of itself, is not even
close to Darwinian stupidity because trains are loud. They announce
their approach from a distance, giving pedestrians ample time to clear
their path. However our Darwin contender stacked the odds in the train's
favor by wearing headphones with the music turned up loud. Louder than
the train's whistle, apparently.

<P>The news report didn't mention what song he was listening to, may have
been <em>'Slow Train Coming'</em> by Dylan. Despite several loud blasts of
the horn by the train engineer, our Darwin contender kept strolling down
the rails in a musical reverie until the Amtrak train offered him an
alternative Greatest Hits smash&mdash;removing him from the gene pool in
one quick blow.
