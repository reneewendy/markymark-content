(3 October 2012, Serra, Brazil) The merits of this potential Darwin Award winner are solid, yet something stands in the way...

Consider a bus traveling along the streets of a busy modern city such as Serra, Brazil. The bus driver, guided by instinct developed over years of experience, is expertly navigating the narrow streets of the metro area. Suddenly a passenger throws in a new variable: He stands on the seat and hangs his torso out the window, wiggling around and whooping it up. The Darwin Awards editors are honor-bound to divulge that this sounds super-duper fun. Arms extended, hair a'flying, an undeniably W00T activity.

Yet to do so effectively increases the width of a bus by two feet. Head, please meet your nemesis in the form of a utility pole. The streets are narrow. Now you know!

Solid Darwin Award.

"Bus-ted." But wait! The printing press comes to a screeching halt. Open dialog between Darwin Awards editors and worldwide fans has reached a consensus that we cannot print the story of this passenger pigeon. Why? Because the deceased individual is a female aged 14. Our magical thinking holds that at 18 the deceased is dumb, and not a day before that birthday. The answer to your question, Intrepid News Reporter C. Elias, is that your submission is a Darwin Award in all aspects--except the age of the perp. In our archives females are underrepresented 10:1, yet we must kill this submission. Humans who are 14 years young are denied the solace of a Darwin Award.

Her parents insisted she should go nevertheless."</FONT>

Necrosage: "Just because they're under the age of consent in the USA doesn't mean that they are under the age in the country where this happened. I believe that this SHOULD be included."<P align=left>

Sondra A: "How many females around the world have already had at least one child by the age of 14? 18 is adult only in a very small percentage of countries."<P align=left>

John H: "Perhaps this Darwin Award could be deferred until what would have been her 18th..."<P align=left>

Andreas F: "At 14 the brain is undergoing major restructuring and rational thought is basically unable to enter the premises. So your exclusion from the award seems legit..."<P align=left>

Bart R: "Pff even for a 14 year old, it is a stupid action."<P align=left>

Bruce K: "Dead of stupidity, no matter what age, is still Award-worthy. As the DA tagline says, who are we to argue with natural selection?"<P align=left>

Jacopo S: "It's stupid to exclude this candidate, there is no place for political correctness in a website that jokes about death itself."<P align=left>

Rachel H: "Very disappointed in the Darwin Awards copy for this one: 'driver's instincts [sic] honed by years of experience.' That's NOT instinct, dumbo - that's LEARNING."<P align=left>

Cindy G: "Grabbed this off the internet: 'Instincts are formed after a contribution from two parties, the animal and its niche. They are the tie lines that bind both together so they become one. The animal has a predisposition to learn, the niche teaches, and each thread in the partnership of attunement they create is the instinct.'"
