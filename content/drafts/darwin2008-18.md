(24 August 2008, Jakarta, Indonesia) Charles had everything going for him.
He had just completed his International Baccalaureate at King William's
College in the Isle of Man, and his dreams were ambitious. He planned
retire by the age of thirty. The principal of the college posthumously
described him as "a very bright boy with a very bright future."

real live wire!"</FONT></P>

Unfortunately for Charles, his elite education omitted an important lesson
from the curriculum: <B>Electricity, danger of.</B>

He had one foot in the backyard swimming pool (really) when he noticed a
cement box full of electrical wires near the edge of the pool.	It was a
junction box supplying power to the jacuzzi. Curious, Charles started to
fiddle with a fistful of wires, and was immediately rooted to the spot--by
240 volts of electrical current surging through his body.

A bright future and early retirement were, indeed, in his cards.
