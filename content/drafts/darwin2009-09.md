<I>Double Darwin!</I>

(26 September 2009, Belgium) The city of Dinant is the backdrop for this
rare Double Darwin Award. Two bankrobbers attempting to make a sizeable
withdrawal from an ATM died when they overestimated the quantity of
dynamite needed for the explosion. The blast demolished the building the
bank was housed in. Nobody else was in the building at the time of the
attack.

Robber One was rushed to the hospital with severe head trauma; he died
shortly after arrival.	Investigators initially assumed that his accomplice
had managed a getaway, but the second bungler's body was excavated from the
debris twelve hours later. Would-be Robbers One and Two weren't exactly
impoverished--their getaway car was a BMW.
