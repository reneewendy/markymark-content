(6 December 2005, Colorado) <U>"87 Days Without An Accident,"</U> the construction site sign proudly proclaimed, until Mr. Ryan Young reset that count to zero.

People get stir crazy in the cold dark days of winter. With the temperatures below freezing and gales of wind rattling the windows, Mr. Young had to get out of the house. He bundled up, grabbed a length of rope, and headed for the University of Colorado campus. By the time he arrived the winds had died down, leaving the night cold and quiet.

The security fence around the construction site was easy to scale, and the 10-story crane (about 35 meters high) was an alluring target for a thrill-seeking young man in the dead of winter. Mr. Young climbed that crane, tied his rope to the bitter end of the boom, and swung out joyfully free -- "Whoop! Whoop!" -- until a rude encounter with the campus power station building across the street

At 22 years of age, Mr. Young lived up to his name as he plummeted to his unfortunate death.

The construction site reportedly followed proper safety procedures. The
perimeter was fenced and the crane's operator cabin was locked. Our regrets
are offered to the family, while our award is offered to the young man for
exemplifying the qualities of a bold winner -- a Darwin Award winner!
