	 <IMG src="/i/art/banwell/darwin2000-50.gif" width="200" height="296" align="right">(29 September 2000, South Carolina) A 32-year-old man hitching a ride on a pallet truck died when the vehicle passed under a bridge at 55mph and the concrete overpass struck the man's head. The driver told police that he had warned the riders not to sit up there but they were "hardheaded." Apparently the deceased wasn't hardheaded enough!

(January 2001, Australia) A 37-year-old man was enjoying the night air with his buddy, watching the stars overhead, feeling the Land Cruiser rocking gently beneath him as his wife drove him home... when an unexpected jolt flung Dean from the roof of the sports utility vehicle and into the night sky. Police said, "The deceased had been drinking, but what they were doing on the roof I'm not sure."
