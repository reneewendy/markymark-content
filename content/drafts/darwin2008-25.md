<!-- 7.4 / 10 (2231) rewritten -->

(27 December 2008, Serbia) 23-year-old Strahinja Raseta was wanted by
Croatian police for murder, and for a spectacular robbery of a central post
office. But even bad guys have friends.	 Aided by his friend, who lent
Raseta E15,000. he fled to Serbia to evade the law. Some loans can never
be repaid.

This was such a loan. Finding himself unable to earn or steal the funds
needed to reimburse his friend, Raseta attempted to end the matter in
another way -- by murdering him!

He crawled under his lender's Jeep to plant a powerful Repayment(R) Brand
explosive. However the muffler was still hot, and the heat set off the
explosive while Raseta was beneath the vehicle. He died in hospital in the
Serbian capital city of Belgrade, illustrating the truth of the adage,
"Neither a borrower nor a lender be."
