(24 June 2007, Colorado) If you cut the rug on an oil tank, be careful not
to light a cigarette, else you may soon be climbing the proverbial
"Stairway to Heaven". After smoking marijuana and liquoring themselves up
at a popular party spot in Routt National Forest, a group of teens decided
that it would be fun to leap and cavort on an oil tank.

The energetic gyrations of the dancers caused fumes to leak from the relief
valve, and "there were several ignitions sources," according to the
sheriff. People were smoking, and there was a bonfire nearby.	One of
these ignition source sparked a "flashdance" and the crude oil storage tank
exploded, hurling two men 150 yards to their deaths.

The deceased were identified as Samuel and Christopher, 17 and 19.

<A href="/rules/">To Review the Rules:</A>

1. Reproduction:<BR> At 17 and 19, they had not yet reproduced, nor can
they now reproduce.

2. Self Selection:<BR>
They thought it was wise to jump on an oil tank containing 160
barrels of crude oil, while stoned out of their gourds.

3. Excellence:<BR>
Stoned insensible, drunker than drunk, and dancing
on a oil tank exuding flammable vapors near a campfire.

4. Maturity:<BR>
Both are over the minimum age of 16.

5. Veracity: MSNBC.com and AP.

<!-- Samuel Hedemark, 17, Phippsburg; Christopher Fuller, 19, Yampa -->
