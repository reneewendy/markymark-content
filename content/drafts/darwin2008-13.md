(13 January 2008, Florida) Wearing only swim trunks and sneakers, a
37-year-old man raced his motorcycle toward the Manasota Key drawbridge.
As the bridge began to open, it was clear that he intended to "shoot the
gap." Bridge designers had anticipated such lunacy and invented the
crossing guard. The closing gates swept him off his Suzuki, over the side
of the bridge, into the water, and out of the gene pool. By a twist of fate
the motorcycle continued up the ramp and made it across to the other side.

point: 'Not accidents! Crashes. Almost every crash can be prevented by
avoiding distractions while driving.' Now I mentally correct news reports
of driving accidents. Switching to the term 'car crash' has made me a
safer driver."</I></FONT>
