(India) In 2004 a pre-wedding henna party was underway when a prowler with
the appearance of an undead ghoul broke into the home of Indira Vegas, 23,
a well-known red-headed stripper in downtown Delhi. While most of the
party reacted with confusion as the prowler lurched forward, in a foetid
cloud that reportedly reeked of "tear gas," Vegas approached the zombie and
whacked its temple with her 5" stiletto heel. According to an eyewitness
report, this dispatched the prowler, successfully halting a Class I
invasion. What makes this story worthy of Darwin's notice however, is the
subsequent actions of Vegas.

She put the stiletto-heel shoe back on and went on to accidentally infect
her sister-in-law, with what one neighbor described as a 'mis-step.' The
name and whereabouts of the sister-in-law have not been released to the
press.	The woman, infected with a strange painful lassitude, passed into a
"deep sleep" and was placed in a bedroom.

The photographer, Timothy Caes, 16, stated that the party was discussing
who should report the deceased prowler to police, when a second ghoul
emerged from the bedroom and began to savagely bite Vegas. Mr. Caes, the
primary source of this report, is a local student who was not known to the
group.	He states that subsequent to this savage attack, Vegas inexlicably
turned and began to menace him.	 Mr. Caees was able to subdue the reanimated
zombies by bashing them several times with a tripod, knocking them to the
floor and halting their wails.	

That was enough. The sudden silence provoked a stampede of human chaos
from the room, and what was effectively a herd of vertical bayonettes put
an end to what was ultimately recorded as a "schizophrenic episode" on the
part of the deceased.

Indra Vegas, who began her 15 minutes of fame by saving her friends, ended
her life with yet another boneheaded move involving high heels.	 Women,
high heels? Between you and me, put those things in your trash. High Heels
= Natural Selection in Action.

Other High Heels Tragedies: Best wishes from Wendy Darwin.
