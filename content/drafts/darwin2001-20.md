(May 2001, Croatia) A college student dropped the ball when a hand grenade exploded while he juggled it at a party in Vidovci. Six students watching him were also injured. A spectator is usually disqualified from winning a Darwin Award caused by another's idiocy, but this audience should have known better than to gape at a man juggling explosives. The six onlookers earn At-Risk Survivors for their disregard of common sense, and the juggler wins a Darwin for his lethal stupidity.
