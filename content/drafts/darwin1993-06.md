	 <P>(3 February 1990, Washington) The following mind-boggling
attempt at a crime spree appeared to be the robber's first try, due to his
lack of a previous record of violence AND his terminally stupid
choices, as follows:</P>

	 <P>1. His target was H&J Leather & Firearms - <I><U>a gun shop.</U></I></P>

	 <P>2. The shop was full of customers - <I><U>firearms customers.</U></I></P>

	 <P>3. To enter the shop, the robber had to <I><U>step around a
marked police patrol car parked at the front
door.</U></I></P>

	 <P>4. A uniformed officer was <I><U>standing at the counter</U></I> having coffee before
work.</P>

	 <P>Upon entering the premises, the would-be robber announced a holdup and
fired a few wild shots.	 The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire,
covered by several customers who also drew their guns, thereby removing the
confused criminal from the gene pool.

	 <P>No one else was hurt.</P>

		 &quot;I'm the photo editor of the South County Journal newspaper and also a long time fan of the Darwin Awards. I received your book as a Christmas Gift and recognized this award as a story we reported in February, 1990, about the man who attempts to rob a gun store in Washington after walking past a parked police car. I pulled our clip file this morning to confirm my memory and see that we ran several stories on the incident.&quot; Darwin has the clips in her possession.
