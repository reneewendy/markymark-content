(28 November 2006, Austria) Once the videotape from a monitoring camera was
reviewed, all became clear. A man who had been reported missing was found
the following morning in a trash compactor, victim of a self-induced
industrial accident.

He worked for a parcel delivery service in Hall in Tirol. He had loaded
the hydraulic press with empty boxes and started it up.	 At that point, the
long-time employee walked to the edge of the charging (filling) hole and
used his foot to press the boxes further into the hydraulic trash
compactor.

His foot was was seized by the press, and he was drawn into the chamber and
crushed. He was not discovered until his colleagues needed to use the press
again the next day.
