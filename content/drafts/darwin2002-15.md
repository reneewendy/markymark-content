<P>(15 June 2002, England) A tree surgeon, 28, decided to save time and
throw the pruned branches of a fir directly into a fire he built near the
base of the tree. ALL trees burn, especially fir trees. Predictably, the
tree caught fire, putting an end to his further time-saving
innovations. True story! <!-- Richard Coates, 28, of Corbridge, Northumberland --></P>
