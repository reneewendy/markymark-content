<P>(December 1997, Pennsylvania) Jerome Bullock, a prisoner in the new
Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh, attempted to evade his punishment by
engineering an escape from confinement. Jerome constructed a hundred-foot
rope of bedsheets, broke through a supposedly shatter-proof cell window,
amd began a hand-over-hand climb to freedom down his makeshift ladder.

<P>It is not known whether his plan took into account the curiosity of
drivers on the busy street and Liberty Bridge below. It certainly did not
take into account the sharp edges of the glass, the worn nature of the
bedsheet, nor the great distance to the pavement. The bottom of the knotted
bedsheet was 86 feet short of the ground. But our hero did not reach the
end of the rope. The window pane sliced through the weak cloth and dropped
him to his untidy demise 150 feet below.<!-- Jerome Bullock, 18 --></P>
<P>But wait there's more!</P>
<P>(3 November 1998) Apparently the rumor of the previous death did not
reach a prisoner at the same jail, who was awating transfer to federal
penitentary. One year later, he tied eight bedsheets together and
rappelled from his seventh-floor window, only to find the rope fell 25 feet
short of the ground. Luckier than Jerome, he merely fractured his ankle and
scraped his face.</P>
