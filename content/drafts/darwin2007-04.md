(1 January 2007, Netherlands) The first Darwin Award of 2007 goes to Serge,
36, who thought it reasonable to hover over an illegal professional
firework and light the <I>electronic</I> ignition with an open flame. This
was not a traditional fuse--it was a device designed for precision timing,
and a flame should not have been used at all. Regardless of the fuse type,
a person's head should never be placed in the way of a firework.

The heat triggered an immediate launch and the fireworks catapulted
upwards, killing our amateur pyrotechnician enroute to a spectacular burst
across the night sky.

A witness told reporters, "His face disappeared. If someone has no face
left, you know it's serious." Serge had purchased the firework legally in
Belgium but then illegally transported it into the Netherlands. His father
disputed the notion that Serge was careless, characterizing his son as a
man who gave due consideration to his acts.

Every year another idiot gets nominated for a Darwin Award for this same
reason.	 Please, readers, keep your itchy fingers off the triggers of these
dangerous fireworks! <!-- Serge Sluijters -->
