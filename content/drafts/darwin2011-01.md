it's not right to cause thousands of dollars worth of damage, for hundreds
of dollars in profit. <FONT size="-1">HEY YOU IMMORAL IDIOTS,</FONT> It
makes bad environmental sense to destroy more than you recoup.	Angry
lecture!

jinja-sidebar: <P id="sidebar1"> <B>Copper Kills!</B> CE Electric UK recently began marking the copper
using <A

technology to deter malicious, costly vandalism. American Electric
Power is converting from copper grounding wire to copper-clad steel
wire that has little scrap value and is tougher to cut. </FONT></P>

Knowing that species evolve, why are we so dumb? Like Darwin's Finches,
humans are filling the 'new islands' (evolutionary niches) created by our
civilization, and our mutations are being tuned by each self-limiting step
we take.

Which brings me to a Leeds teenager, who at 16 became a deceased Darwin
Award winner by making one such self-limiting step. Copper theft is a
killer, and also a nuisance. CE Electric UK has dealt with 279 incidents in
the last year in West Yorkshire. They plead, "We are pleading with thieves
to think about the consequences and how much they are risking for such a
small return. DANGER OF DEATH signs are posted for a reason!"

Stealing copper? Fast track train to Charles Darwin's heavenly
estate. "Welcome home, Leeds teen. You were old enough to know better!"
Sometimes a friend has to cram life into too few years, but we comfort
ourselves knowing that his destiny was to serve as a warning to others.
