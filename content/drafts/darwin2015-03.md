(14 January 2015, New Zealand) Finally some rest for Matthew Smith, 26,
killed while trying to silence noisy late-night music at the Whangaruru
Beachfront Motor Camp in Oakura.

Loud teenage tunes blared out from the neighboring caravan for hours,
making sleep impossible! Half an hour after midnight our exasperated
Darwin Award winner, a sound and lighting technician, set out to sort out
the problem with a metal Leatherman tool.

The coroner determined that Mr Smith disconnected the power cord from the
caravan, then tried to sever the plug from the cord whilst the other end
was still connected to the campground power box. At 3AM he was found dead
with the <EM>Leatherman tool fused to his hand,</EM> along with a half-cut
power cord.

Ironically, the rowdy teenagers had battery-powered lamps and speakers so
the loss of power was not immediately investigated. The person who found
Matthew nearly became another Darwin Award winner, received a nasty shock
upon touching the smoking body! This person then went on to unplug the live
cord !! from the power box before calling emergency services.

Police were satisfied that there was no foul play. The power authority was
satisfied with the condition of the campground power source. A Ground Fault
Circuit Interruptor (GFCI or RCD) would have saved Matthew's life, but such
are required only at new campsite installations. The coroner recommended
RCD's be installed at all New Zealand caravan parks to protect people from
harmful electric shocks.

"The reality here is that the disconnection should have been at the
power box, not the camper van," said Fire Brigade Deputy Chief Gallagher.
