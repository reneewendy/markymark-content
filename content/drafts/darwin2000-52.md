"Something strange is happening to Malaysia executioners manning the gallows. Three people in the last two years have accidentally hanged themselves while clowning around. The most recent mishap occurred when the executioner prepared for an upcoming sentence and slipped the noose around his neck. Apparently he wanted pictures taken of himself standing on the gallows when the trap door gave way, breaking his neck instantly. "<FONT size="-1"> &nbsp;<BR>

		<P align="left"><A href="mailto:REMOVE-jah@ilink.co.za">Kobus</A> says, &quot;I just had to comment on the policeman who piloted the speedboat	 over Loskop Dam.

"Loskop" is a Afrikaans	 word that translates to "scatter brain," which puts a whole new twist on this tale!&quot;

says, &quot;Bay City man shot in the leg while trying to photograph his dog holding a rifle, which accidentally went off... This has it all! Adventure: a man and his gun. Love: a man and his dog. Pathos: a dog shooting his man. Humor: a man shot by a dog! Mystery: &quot;Why in the hell...?&quot;
It's a Greek tragedy in one short, stupid act.&quot;
