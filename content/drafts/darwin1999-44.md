<B>These five random snippets were collected from emails over the past decade. Their origins and veracity are mostly unknown.</B></P>
<P> (10 August 1999) A man in a diabetic shock swerved off Route 2 in Lincoln, Massachusetts. His car plowed through a telephone pole and impacted a tree, where it burst into flames. Onlookers took him for dead, and were shocked to see him walk away from the crash unhurt. However, when he looked back and noticed that his car was on fire, he tried to put it out, and electrocuted himself on one of the high voltage power lines that had fallen when he hit the telephone pole. <FONT size="-1"><BR>

<P> A 23-year-old bar-brawling man, who had been escorted out of the Turtle Club in Florida by a bouncer, sneaked back in and leaped off a staircase, trying to kick another man, but was killed when he landed on his head. The kick was ineffectual.
