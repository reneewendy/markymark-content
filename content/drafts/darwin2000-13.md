<A href="/art/banwell/" target="_top"><IMG src="/i/art/banwell/banwell.darwin2000-13.gif" width="238" height="300" align="right" border="0"></A>(16 August 1999) Daniel was tired to death - literally -- at the Buckeye Ford Dealership in London. He had sneaked onto the lot in the wee hours of the morning with theft on his mind. His modus operandi was to jack up the back of a pickup truck, remove the wheels, heave them into the bed of a hot-wired Buckeye Ford pickup, and move on to the next target. Daniel possessed what local police referred to as "an extensive criminal background," and had apparently spent years honing his craft. But his expertise failed him this time. The pickup was half full when the 47-year-old thief's next (and final) target slipped off the jack and landed squarely on his chest at 4AM. A clear case of live by the truck, die by the truck. <!-- Daniel Nolan, 47 -->

	 <P>In a related incident, Police in London, Ohio say a thief was killed while stealing tires from a Ford dealership. Employees found the body of Daniel Nolan, 47, when they arrived for work Monday morning. The jack holding up a truck slipped and crushed him.		</P>
