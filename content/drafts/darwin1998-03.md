<IMG src="/i/art/banwell/darwin1998-03.gif" width="200" height="276" align="right">(01 March 1998) Randy Nestor, 28, was a considerate car thief. When the stolen cars became hot, he didn't just abandon them, he torched them. Setting the cars on fire, he reasoned, helped the owners collect insurance on their vehicles.
This criminal habit became his downfall. After a 10-year career of theft,
Randy burned to death in Pittsburgh, PA in a van which he had set fire to from the inside. He hadn't realized that the door handle on the driver's side was broken. Friends tried to release him, but the door was locked. His burned body was found inside the van on Sunday.
