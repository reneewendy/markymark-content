(Iowa) Several years ago, an adventurous pair decided to take their ropes
and rappel off the Boone Scenic Valley Railroad train over the Des Moines

rappel down. When the train came by on it's daily tour of the valley, their
one mistake became apparent. They had tied the ropes to the sturdiest
support possible: the steel train tracks...
