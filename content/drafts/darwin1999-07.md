<p>(22 March 1999, Phnom Penh) Like a magician, he pulled out a 25-year-old unexploded anti-tank mine found in his
backyard. 'This will win the argument!' he said, speaking in one of the 12 languages
of Cambodia.

Three FRENEMIES were sharing drinks and exchanging insults at a cafe in Svay
Rieng, southeast Cambodia. Their friendish arguments continued for hours
and the tone escalated. Finally one disgruntled man had his fill of BS.

<span id="sidebar2">The game was a crazy mix of Russian Roulette and
Flaming Bag of Poo</span>

He tossed the claymore under the table, and
the men began playing a crazy mix of "russian roulette" and "flaming bag of
dog poo", each tossing down a drink and stomping the mine. The other
villagers fled in terror.

The cafe patrons were deeply aware of the consequences headed this
way. Decades of armed strife have littered Cambodia with dangerous
unexploded munitions. The aftermath of war is dreadful. Citizens are
constantly reminded not to tamper with the decaying war machines.<P>

Minutes later, the bomb detonated with a tremendous force, killing the
three men in the bar. "Their wives could not even find their remains
because the blast destroyed everything," the Rasmei Kampuchea newspaper
reported. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cambodia/@12.1363981,102.7361403,1329281m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x310787bfd4dc3743:0xe4b7bfe089f41253!8m2!3d12.565679!4d104.990963">You
can still see the crater</a> on Google Maps. <strong>Just
kidding!</strong>
