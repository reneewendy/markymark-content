(1989, South Africa) Downtown Johannesburg is continuously growing with the
construction of modern new buildings. One such building was designed with a
steel framework, intended to be clad in glass as a final touch.

On the eighteenth floor, an engineer was inspecting the framework. He asked
one of the workers to stand on a scaffold that was projecting through an
open space where the glass panel would soon be mounted. With the worker
acting as a counterweight, the engineer walked out onto the scaffold,
checked the exterior, and came back in to continue his inspection.

After the engineer left, curiosity got the better of the worker. He walked out on the scaffold to see what the engineer was looking at...

Fortunately the falling worker did not take out any pedestrians!

The worker removed himself from the gene pool out of sheer stupidity. But one does wonder whether that engineer is blithely continuing to ask trusting people to act as counterweights without explaining his reason, and leaving a trail of bodies in his wake!
