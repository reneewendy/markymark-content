<IMG src="/i/icon/grenade.gif" align="right" border="0">(13 January 2005,
Croatia) One fateful afternoon, 55-year-old Marko retreated to his
semi-detached workshop to make himself a tool for chimney cleaning. The
chimney was too high for a simple broom to work, but if he could attach a
brush to a chain and then weigh it down with something, that would do the
trick.	But what could he use as a weight?

He happened to have the perfect object.	 It was heavy, yet compact. And
best of all, it was made of metal, so he could weld it to the chain. He
must have somehow overlooked the fact that it was also a hand grenade and
was filled with explosive material.

Marko turned on his welding apparatus and began to create an arc between
the chain and the grenade. As the metal heated up, the grenade
exploded. The force of the explosion killed poor Marko instantly, blasting
shrapnel through the walls of the shed and shattering the windshield of a
Mercedes parked outside. Marko's chimney was untouched, however.
