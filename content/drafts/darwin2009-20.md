(10 December 2009, Philippines) This small island nation has already
produced several of the most illustrious Darwin Award winners. <A
href="/darwin/darwin1999-34.html">Intelligence Blunders:</A> National
Bureau of Investigation agents cop a smoke in a room full of seized
explosives, and <A href="/darwin/darwin2000-19.html">Home Grown
Parachute:</A> An airplane hijacker robs passengers then bails out with an
untested homemade parachute. Now the Philippines have produced that rare
oddity, the Double Darwin Award.

We begin with Francisco C. and Ronaldo C., two businessmen who own restaurants adjacent to one another on Apacible Boulevard in Batangas. Their tempers erupt over a poorly parked car.

One has partially blocked the door to the other's establishment, and this does not sit well. Heated words are exchanged, a fistfight breaks out! But bystanders pacifiy the fighters, and the situation is defused. Or is it?

Each man retreats to his respective car, pulls out a gun, and shoots the other--killing both. Francisco suffered two bullet wounds to his chest, Renaldo was shot once beneath his arm. Francisco, 41, and Ronaldo, 39, two enemies brought together in death--much to their own chagrin.
