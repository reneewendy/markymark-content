		<P>With those murmured words, a Russian professor quaffed an aliquot of clear fluid from a beaker... and slowly succumbed to methanol poisoning.
</P>
		<P>
The Oxford University professor had been in the habit of drinking laboratory ethanol until he unwittingly poured his last drink from a bottle of methanol. According to Usenet scientists, methanol is a common lab solvent that looks and smells like ethanol but is "five times as toxic and five times less intoxicating." Those who drink it invariably drink too much.
		<P>
"By the time methanol symptoms are recognized, treatment, including kidney dialysis, may be too late."
The 44-year-old professor of Ecology was said to have had poor vision, and probably misread the label.
