<!-- 7.3 / 10 (2372) minor edit -->

(30 May 2009, Louisiana) Back seat drivers beware! Annoyed at how slowly
her boyfriend was driving, Tamera B, 22, encouraged him to pick up the pace
so she could get to work on time. Joking that it would be faster to walk to
work, she opened the door of the pickup truck and stuck her foot out before
falling to her death.

But wait! Was her complaint valid? Nope. Deputies of the jurisdictional
Sheriff's Office stated that the truck was traveling at highway speed on
I-12 at the time of the incident. Her death was ruled accidental.
