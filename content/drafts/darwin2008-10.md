The telephone company was replacing above-ground telephone lines with
buried lines. In one sparsely populated farming area, if lines crossed a
country road they would dig a trench halfway across, so rural traffic could
continue through. Then they would fill in the trench, and dig a trench on
the other side.

One morning, local farmers called the sheriff to report a smashed-up
pickup.	 Inside were two ranch hands who were last seen the previous night,
heading home after last call. You see...

On their way to the bars, the men had decided to play a prank.	They
stopped their pickup, and moved the flashing warning signs from the
trenched side to the good side of the country road. Crime scene analysis
later confirmed that they were the culprits who moved the flashing stands.
Investigations also revealed that at the time of the accident, they were
driving at an excessive speed with an impressive amount of alcohol in their
systems.

No crime scene analysis is capable of determining whether the ranch hands
forgot their prank, or chose to see what would happen if they hit that
trench at a high rate of speed in the middle of the night.

No good prank goes unpunished.
