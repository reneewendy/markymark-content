(28 January 2018, Selangor Malaysia) Zaim Kosnan
spotted a twelve-foot reticulated python dozing on the side of the
road. "That sizeable snake is worth money!" The 35-year-old prepared for
this windfall with gloves and a sickle.

Sweet success! Swiftly was the first round won, and triumphantly Zaim held the reptile's head high as he transported it home by motorbike. Picture that crazy scene.

Swinging in the air, the displeased captive made a counter-move and wrapped its body round and round its captor, constricting in self-defense. Zaim swerved off the road and the results of Round Two became apparent to passers-by the next morning. They killed The 3.5 meter snake to free the man's body, and a post-mortem confirmed his death by strangulation.

Zaim Khalis was described as a quiet person who kept to himself.
