(2008) Darren was dumb even for a junkie, but what he lacked in IQ he made
up in creativity. In the supermarket, he notice a bag labeled
"Birdseed 100% Poppy Seed." He seized his chance to circumvent the
stranglehold of the International Drug Cartels with the following logic:
100% Poppy Seed = 100% Opium! Figuring he was onto something good, he
bought a bag of birdseed, boiled it into a thick black paste, and proceeded
to inject it into his vein.

Nothing happened, so he did it again.

An hour later, he was brought unconscious to our Emergency Department, as
sick as it is possible to be. His chest X-ray showed thousands of tiny
seed-like objects scattered throughout his lungfields. Our working
diagnosis was Milary Tuberculosis, so-called because the TB deposits
resemble millet seeds. Little did we know!

Only two weeks later, after he recovered from life-threatening septicaemia
and multiple organ failure, did the true story emerge.	Darren survived,
but subsequently died of a garden variety overdose.
