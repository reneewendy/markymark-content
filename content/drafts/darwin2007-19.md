(9 December 2007, Indiana) Russell, 19, had a grudge against a semi truck
abandoned on a rural property.	And Russell was not the silent, brooding
type. He was a man of action. He built a gunpowder and propane tank bomb,
attached a timer, planted it in the moldering truck, and retreated to a
distant vantage point to wait for the fireworks.

And waited.

And waited, until he could wait no more. No boom? This was not right. Why
was nothing happening? Russell approached the stubborn truck--just in time
for an up-close-and-personal look at a cloud of rapidly expanding
incandescent gas.

Detectives found bomb-making materials at Russell's mobile home, and
believe he was also responsible for two explosions the night before his
death, one at the mobile home park and another at a hobby shop. Although
Russell will be missed, we are all a bit safer now.
