<A href="/art/banwell/" target="_top"><IMG src="/i/art/banwell/banwell.darwin2000-18.gif" width="203" height="308" align="right" border="0"></A>(11 April 2000, Kentucky) Larry and his friend Silas decided to reenact the William Tell scene where the famous archer is forced to test his prowess by shooting an apple off his son's head. But instead of apples, they used a beer can, which was closer to hand. You might suspect that the pair were teenagers, but in fact they were grown men of 47. Larry put the beer can on his head and urged Silas to shoot. But Silas missed the can, fatally wounding his lifelong friend Larry on Tuesday night.Authorities said the men had been drinking, and that the shooting was not prompted by an earlier altercation in the parking lot. <!-- Larry Slusher, 47, and Silas Caldwell, 47 -->

If two slack-jawed yokels are playing with their rifles and drinking beer, and one invites the other to shoot at his head, and thus gets his brains splattered all over the place, has a crime really been commited? If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound? If I pontificate on a website, will anybody care?<BR>

Sound and vibrations are not the same thing. Sound is a brain's interpretation of atmospheric vibrations hitting an eardrum. If there is no brain as in this case, all the vibrations in the world won't make a sound.<BR>

If Hellen Keller fell down in the forest, would she make a sound?<BR>

The amount of damage being done to new growth in the forest by some fat, blind, deaf socialist stumbling through is a terrifying thought. In natural selection, shouldn't Hellen Keller have been eaten by her parents to preserve the gene pool? <BR>

Yee-Haw! Love it. The big three.
Rednecks + alcohol + firearms = a sure finalist.<BR>

I checked around and found this story in a number of large newspapers. Here is a quote which may be relevent to prove that the guy was shot as a result of his own stupidity.
''The one that got shot put the beer can up on the top of his head and told his buddy to shoot it off. He missed the can and hit his head,'' said Bell County sheriff Harold Harbin. ''I don't think there were any arguments, because they were the best of friends.''

Darwin in its truest form. I rarely give 10s but this one deserves it.<BR>

Darwin for sure but makes you wonder if the friend will collect on the life insurance? If my friend asked me to shoot a beer off his head, I'd make sure there was something in it for me.<BR>
