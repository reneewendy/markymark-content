	 <DIV align="left">(November 2000, England) A husband who frequently asked his wife to cover his nose and mouth with her nightie during lovemaking, decided to add a plastic bag to his repertoire of solo sex tools. Martin, 34, pulled a plastic bag over his head and used a vacuum cleaner to remove the air. He was found lying by the still-running vacuum cleaner, fully clothed, dead, still holding the plug. <!-- Martin Hunt -->
