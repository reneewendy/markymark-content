<p>(16 April 1999, Washington DC) Darwin Award wannabee's know how
valuable a good paramedic is. After a near miss, who you gonna call?
Bad news. There are two fewer medics around to save us.

Mark T <!-- Mark Trowbridge --> was a proud 10-year paramedic with
the DC Fire Department. Carol S <!-- Carol Smith --> was studying to
be an EMT for the Fire Department. Science and medicine were their best
tools. So certainly these two were familiar with the science of nitrous
oxide gas.

Laughing gas N<sub>2</sub>O is a common and popular relaxant in dental
offices. Loved on the street for its short-lived high with no
after-effects. But speaking of short-lived... there is something you need
to know about nitrous.

Every pure gas must be mixed with oxygenated air before you use it as your
main supply. Without oxygen, any pure gas will cause suffocation. That is
the law. You can volunteer to breathe other gases, but you need 21% Oxygen
O<sub>2</sub> or you will die.

Unfortunately, these two adults forgot. In the comfort of their suburban
home, Carol and Mark sealed respiratory masks onto their faces and plugged
into a canister of nitrous. Sadly they were found dead still wearing the masks
attached to the silver bottles. Mark was only 40 years, Carol was only 30 years
on the planet.

What makes these two extraordinary candidates for the coveted Darwin Award,
is that BOTH had enough medical training to know better. The DC Fire
Department PIO said Mark was "one of the most educated and highly trained
people we had."

<P><A href="mailto:REMOVE-mol[itude]bio[key]@excite[ment].commm"><B>Joseph Oh</B></A><B> Complains:<BR>
</B>&quot;You have a great site; I've spent many an idle moment chuckling
at the often antics of our fellow humans. I was however appalled to read
one comment. Paramedics and EMTs are dedicated, hard-working men and women
who do a difficult and thankless job, not for the pay (which is often poor)
but to help their fellow man. To say that it is fortunate to have two fewer
paramedics in the world is tasteless and ignorant, and the editor needs to
keep that particular opinion off the air. The next time a family member has
a medical emergency, let's hear him say that.&quot;
<P><B>Darwin Wendy Answers:<BR>
</B>Joseph you are absolutely right. My comment struck a nerve, and rightly
so. I&nbsp;value paramedics and have rewritten my account to be more
respectful. But all the same, I don't want two questionable thinkers like
this strapping my face to a tank of gas on the way to the ER. I hope this
sad outcome for Mark and Carol, helped guide others away from harm.&quot;
