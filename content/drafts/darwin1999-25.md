(3 December 1999, Denmark) A powerful winter storm plowed through Europe. Hurricane-force winds gusted to 110 mph, and massive waves pounded the seashore. One woman was anxiously watching news of "the worst storm in Denmark this century" when the TV picture suddenly became too grainy to see what was happening. The antenna on the roof had come loose and started banging around.

Determined not to miss any information, and despite the howling winds, she decided to climb up on the roof to fix the antenna. She was blown off the roof by the hurricane winds and killed. As a consolation prize, she became a major part of the news over the next few days.
