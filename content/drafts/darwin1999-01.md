(08 March 1999, Kenya) A middle-aged thief sat quietly through the Sunday
service at All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi. But when the offering basket
was passed, fellow worshippers were astonished to see him stashing handfuls
of the money in his pockets.

Realizing he had been spotted, the thief fled from the church and onto a
busy highway, where a speeding bus killed him. The cause of death? An act
of God. The moral? Don't annoy the ruler of the universe, or you just may wind up a
Darwin Award.
