"Airhead Extends Principle to Abdomen"
</CENTER>

(22 September 1999, Scotland) A Scottish
follower of Breatharianism demonstrated a comprehensive misunderstanding of
biology during her recent attempt to "Live with Light" in the Scottish
Highlands.

Verity, 48, was adhering to a 21-day spiritual cleansing course, wherein
followers of Breatharianism eschew all food and drink for seven days. They
continue to abstain, fourteen more days, from all but sips of water.

During Verity's brief stay in the Scottish Highlands, she endeavor to
master the art of "pranic feeding," surviving on inhaled carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen.

Guru Jasmuheen, an Australian formerly known as Ellen Greve, boasts 5000
followers worldwide, though she does not disclose whether they are always
the <I>same</I> followers. She points out that 'breatharianism' is the
perfect cure for anorexia, and world hunger, as adherents need never eat nor
drink again.

Anorexia sufferers, and hunger victims, have already attempted this course
of action, with known results. Nutritionists say a human can survive
without fluid for six days, at most. These research results did not deter
Verity, who took to the wilds with only a tent and her grit and determination.

She died from hypothermia and dehydration, aggravated by lack of food.

Jasmuheen, whose dress size was not disclosed, claims to have survived on
"liquid air" since 1993, although she does allow herself cups of herbal tea
and chocolate biscuits.	 The founder of the cult said that Verity's death
was not due to physical need for food.	Rather, it was a failure to satisfy
spiritual needs brought about by a battle with her own ego.<!-- Verity Linn

&quot;The Breatharianism story is against the spirit of Darwin Awards
While I reluctantly admit that the Scottish dimwit in the story is indeed deserving of a Darwin on merit, the Award highlights the mind-numbing stupidity of the living human being who gave her the idea. I don't think it's a good idea to let Darwin readers know about living idiots, since it undermines the underlying theory of the awards! Having had a brief look at her book from your link, her stupidity knows no limit, yet she is still alive.&nbsp;<A href="http://DarwinAwards.com/_NONODELETE_/critiques/000390.html">Discuss!</A>&quot;<BR>
