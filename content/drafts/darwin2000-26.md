Horseshoe Falls is on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.
Over a decade ago, a daredevil named Robert equipped himself with a homemade rocket-parachute contraption and rode a jet ski over Horseshoe Falls at full throttle. He planned to ignite the rocket to propel him clear of the falls, then deploy the parachute and float down to the river below, where he would be fished out by the Maid o' the Mist tour boat.

But the water had a dampening effect on his equipment. The rocket failed to ignite and the parachute failed to deploy. However, the third phase of his scheme did work according to plan. His corpse was recovered from the river below by the Maid o' the Mist staff.

Robert was married but had no children, making him a perfect Darwin contender. <!-- Robert Overacker -->

I have lived in Niagara Falls most of my whole life and know this story well. The real reason the man died was because he could not swim; he drowned! He survived the crash, but didn't think to wear a life jacket...&quot;
