(August 1999, Manila) A deadly explosion in the Philippines' National
Bureau of Investigation was linked to <I>careless NBI agents smoking near a
bucketful of dynamite powder.</I> Remnants of hand grenades, bullets, and weapons were
scattered far and wide.

The powerful blast gouged a crater beneath the NBI annex, shattered
third-floor windows near by, and killed seven people including the
cigarette-smoking perpetrators.

The bucket, stored in the NBI annex for over a year, represented a
surprising failure to safeguard seized evidence. Added to this mental lapse
is the image of carefree smokers crushing out their smoldering butts in a
pail of dynamite powder. Group Darwin Award!
