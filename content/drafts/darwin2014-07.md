<B>India zoo gains a meal, loses a patron...</B>

(23 September 2014, India) <B>Life of Pi</B> move over, Maqsood has a tale to tell. This 19-year-old factory worker joined a White tiger for lunch yesterday in the cat's Delhi zoo home. After being cautioned twice to not climb over the fence enclosing the tiger enclosure, Maqsood climbed over the fence a third time and then swam across the moat over to Tiger Island.

Never pet a kitty that isn't yours. The White tiger "went tiger" on the intruder and mauled him to death, subsequently dragging the body around the island for two hours until the animal was finally scared into a cave and the body was retrieved.

Parents of the tiger's visitor said the boy was mentally ill and addicted to <I>bhang,</I> a preparation of cannabis leaves and seeds that is smoked, chewed, eaten, or infused and drunk to obtain mild euphoria. Yet many normal young men are emotionally troubled and enjoy cannabis--and would be shocked and embarrassed were their parents to refer to them as mentally ill addicts.

In some countries such as the United States of America the animal would have been destroyed to satisfy angry citizens; however, in India the killer tiger was characterized as acting in line with its nature and the animal will suffer no punishment for the day's excitement.

The misadventure of Maqsoon brings to mind a pair of India men who brought <A href="http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1996-02.html">Marigold Garlands to a Bengal tiger at the Calcutta Zoo on New Years Day, 1996.</A>
