(11 March 1978, France) The singer Claude Francois, whose stellar career
can be compared to that of Elvis Presley, popularized rock and roll music
in France. One evening, he returned to his Paris apartment from a busy
touring schedule, and ran a bath. While standing in the filled tub, he
noticed a light bulb that wasn't straight, tried to straighten it... and
was electrocuted.

<I>Au revoir, Claude.</I>

"How do you pronounce that, Claude or Clod?"
