(16 July 2008, Italy) Gerhard, 68, was queued at a traffic light in his
Porsche Cayenne SUV. Before one reaches the light, there is a
railroad crossing, and Gerhard had not let the queue progress forward far
enough before he drove onto the tracks.	 As you might imagine, given <A
href="">Murphy's Law</A>, a train was coming.

The safety bars came down, leaving the Porsche trapped on the rails.
According to witnesses, it took the driver awhile to realize he was stuck.
Finally he jumped from the car and started to run--straight toward the
oncoming train, waving his arms in an attempt to save his expensive SUV!

The attempt was partly successful. The car received less damage than its
owner, who landed 30 meters away. Attempts to revive him were
unsuccessful. <!-- Gerhard Adolf Zeitler Plattner, 68 -->

The moral of the story? <B>Momentum always wins.</B>

<P align=left><FONT size=-1><B>Jeff comments pithily,</B> "It is
advised that you do run toward a train if your car is stuck on the tracks,
so that the collision throws the car away from you. In that respect, the
gentleman was in the right. The caveat is that you are supposed to run
toward the train <I>alongside</I> the tracks, not <I>on the tracks!</I>"

sports car, it's an SUV! It makes the story read poorly when you know the
error..."</FONT>
