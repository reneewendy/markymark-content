jinja-title: Skeleton Key


jinja-confirmed: <
jinja-status: draft

	 Another would-be thief has been discovered languishing as a pile of bones, this one by an artisan brick mason. The protruding foot and leg bones found during building renovations belonged to a thief who tried to rob a Gift shop by way of the second-floor chimney fifteen years before, speculated bemused authorities. Maybe he should have tried a skeleton key.

a thing. We wonder how the smell could have been missed -- after
all, it gets hot and humid in Natchez, so wouldn't you think that first
summer was a smelly one?&quot;
