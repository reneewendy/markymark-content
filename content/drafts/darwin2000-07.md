firm for the deaths of two workers. The two 28-year-old men, reportedly
experienced in their work, fell 100 feet after drilling a hole
through thick concrete without realizing they were standing in
the center of the circle. Neither was wearing a safety harness
to arrest his 8-story plunge.

	 <P><B><A href="mailto:REMOVE-bwj@industrynet.net">Bernard
W. Joseph</A></B>, mathematician: &quot;How could they stand in the center of the
circle? If it's a fly-cutter, you would have to keep jumping
over the revolving arm. If it's a core cutter, you can't fit
inside the tube. This is hard to believe.</P>
	 <P><A href="mailto:REMOVE-RWSTYLES@COMPUSERVE.COM"><B>Russell
Styles</B></A><B>: </B>They could have been cutting
a noncircular hole in a slab with a diamond saw. Such a hole
could be easily large enough for two people.</P>
	 <P><B> Bernard: </B>&quot;Any floor of that sort would
use reinforcing rods. They would have had to not only chop out
the concrete, but also cut the rebar. I still think that it's
mechanically improbable.</P>
