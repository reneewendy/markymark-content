(8 February 2005, Caerphilly, Wales) "If Wales wins, I'll cut my balls off," Geoff told his mates at a social club while watching the rugby match between England and its arch-rival. His friends thought the 26-year-old was joking, but after Wales' 11-9 victory over England, he went home, castrated himself with a knife, and walked the length of two rugby fields back to the bar to show his shocked friends the evidence.

It was Wales' first home win over England in 12 years.	Geoff was taken to
a hospital where he remained "in a seriously ill condition."

was reported in the British press. It apparently took him 10 mins to
complete his task!!!"
