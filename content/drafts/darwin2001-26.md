(26 July 2001, Nevada) Sometimes fate has perfect vision. Two men found dead at Lake Tahoe were presumed to be homicide victims -- one disfigured by severe facial wounds and the other apparently shot -- until investigators discovered that they were actually victims of their own larcenous tendencies. The men had stolen a jet ski from a marina but, unfamiliar with the lay of the land and piloting in pitch darkness, they crashed at high speed into a nearby dock. One man died instantly from a broken neck; the other crawled to shore where he, too, expired.
