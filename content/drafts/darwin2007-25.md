<IMG src="/i/art/buckley/Sky_Surfer_200.jpg" align=left>(October 2007,
Ibeza, Spain) Storm winds swept across southern Spain, causing widespread
flooding and damage to buildings along the Costa Blanca. "Cool," thought
one intrepid kite surfer as he packed his gear and hit the beach.

Move over, Charlie Brown. Today's large kites are not helpless fodder for
kite-eating trees, mere triangles held by a string. Modern kites are
controlled by multiple lines, with surface areas that create so much pull
that it can be difficult to keep your feet planted on ground theeven during
normal wind conditions.	 These were not normal conditions. Heavy
rainstorms, flooding and landslides had caused the government to declare a
state of emergency.

"Rad," thought the 40-year-old Spanish surfer as he unfurled his kite,
climbed onto his board, and embarked on the ride of a lifetime.

According to the authorities, the man, who was on a holiday, had gone into
the water defying a bathing ban. The high winds picked him up and
ultimately carried him almost a kilometer inland, tagging him against
buildings along the way. One more nominee joins the queue to meet Charles
Darwin...in person.
