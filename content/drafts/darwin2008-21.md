(Winter 1995, Michigan) During the ski season at Sugarloaf Resort, a new
lift operator was assigned to work the bottom of Lift 2. He was greatly
impressed by the bull wheel that turned slowly above his head. The giant
spokes on the wheel were impossible to resist. He grabbed a spoke and
did a few pull-ups while the wheel turned.

After entertaining himself in this manner for awhile, he decided to try
this trick on the outer rim of the wheel. His timing was off. He did not
drop down in time. Caught between the wheel and the lift cable, he was
sliced in twain during his fateful final trip around the bull wheel.
