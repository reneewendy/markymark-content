(10 July 1999, California) A Yosemite hiker with sore feet stopped to cool his heels in the Merced River, slipped on algae-covered rocks, and was swept over a 594-foot waterfall to his death. Siddiq was climbing Half Dome with three friends on Saturday when his poor choice of rest stops cost him his life.

Signs posted at the falls clearly state, "If you go in the water, you will die." Not only are these warnings displayed in several languages, but they even show a stick figure falling over the edge.

But Siddiq paid no heed to the warnings. As he was carried over the Nevada Falls, his friends were already calling authorities for help from their cell phones. But help could not arrive in time. Rangers recovered Siddiq's body by helicopter a few hours later.

Siddiq is the fourth person to die at Nevada Fall in the last five years, park spokeswoman Christine Cowles said. <!-- Siddiq Parekh, 31 -->
