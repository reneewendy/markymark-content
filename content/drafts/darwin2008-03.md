(January 2008, Pennsylvania) A 23-year-old man with various body piercings
decided to have some fun at work. He wondered, "What it would feel like to
connect the electronic control tester to my chest piercings?" Several
coworkers tried to convince him that it was a bad idea to wire himself up
to the electronic device, but he ignored their pleas.

He proceeded to connect two alligator clips to his metal nipple piercings,
one on each side, and hit the test button... His coworkers were still
trying to revive him with CPR and rescue breathing when police and rescue
personnel arrived. They were not successful.
