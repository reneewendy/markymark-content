(22 November 2007, New York) Joe, 20, was drunkenly driving through Wayne
County farmland in upstate New York. With the utmost of inebriated care,
he steered his car directly into a ditch. Knocked over a power line
too. Oops! How could he rescue his car from the ditch without getting a
DUI?

The <I>only way out</I> was to steal a nearby farm vehicle, and winch the
car out himself. So he aproached the nearest farmhouse, managed to start a
tractor, and motored over to the scene of the accident.	 With the utmost of
inebriated care, he then proceeded to drive several tons of metal directly
into the downed power line.

Goodbye Joe. Hello Darwin Award.
