<P><I>Take a deep breath...</I></P>

(3 June 2006, Florida) Two more candidates have thrown themselves into the
running for a Darwin Award. The feet of Jason and Sara, both 21, were
found protruding from a huge, deflated helium advertising balloon. Jason
was a college student, and Sara attended community college, but apparently
their education had glossed over the importance of breathing oxygen.

<P align="left"><FONT size="-1"><B>When one breathes pure helium</B>
the lack of oxygen in the bloodstream causes a rapid loss of
consciousness. Some euthanasia experts advocate the use of helium to
painlessly end one's life. At least Sara and Jason went
peacefully.</FONT></P>


A family member said, "Sara was mischievous, to be honest." The pair
pulled down the 8' balloon, and climbed inside for a breath of helium
goodness. Their last words consisted of high-pitched, incoherent giggling
as they slowly passed out, and passed into the hereafter.

Sheriff's deputies said the two were not victims of foul play.	They
climbed into the balloon of their own volition, and no drugs or alcohol
were involved.
