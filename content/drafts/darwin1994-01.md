[A robbery attempt gone bad? That's my bet]

An investigation is underway this morning after a death on the campus of Johnson C. Smith University here in Charlotte. Around 12:30 am a security guard found a man pinned underneath a vending machine. When medics arrived the man was pronounced dead. No one from the university has been available for comment.

We have learned the victim was not a student.

		 &quot;Damned if this didn't happen again! A repairman from Canteen Services told me that last night, 5 January 2001, at the Univeristy of North Carolina in Charlotte, a student once again offed himself by pulling a vending machine on top of himself.&quot;<I> --Darwin confirms that a man was crushed beneath a vending machine; however, he suffered a heart attack while unloading a vending machine from a truck. No safety considerations were violated, making this copycat death ineligible for a Darwin Award. </I>
