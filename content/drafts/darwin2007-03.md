(Broome, Australia) When you work as a diver on a pearl farm, there are
many ways to "buy the farm." Our head diver Mitchell Ether, known as Sharky,
was not afraid to take risks to get the job done. He was a loose gun in a
company of cowboys. Sharky seemed destined to make an original exit.

A near miss happened in Roebuck Bay. He miscalculated the amount of fuel
needed for the air compressor that pumps air to the divers below, and the
compressor was about to stop. Instead of FOLLOWING STANDARD PROCEDURE and
bringing everyone up and refuelling during a surface interval, Sharky
surfaced alone to top up the fuel tank while the compressor was still
running!

The deck was unsteady and naturally he spilled some petrol. The compressor
had been running for hours and its red-hot exhaust ignited the spilled
fuel, and the flames followed the fuel into the petrol tank. Boom! The
$200,000 brand-new dive boat was fully kitted out for the pearl farm
including oxygen for resuscitations. Boom! The mushroom cloud from the
oxygen bottle explosion startled observers all the way back in town, five
kilometers away.

Luckily, Sharky jumped back in the water before the big oxygen explosion.
He and his crew were picked up by another dive boat!

Despite this "incident" Sharky was promoted to skipper of a larger
vessel.	 However, the new skipper found excuses to don his old dive gear.
One such excuse was a mooring rope tangled around the propeller. Instead
of asking an outfitted diver for assistance, Sharky chucked on his dive
gear, started the compressor, clipped on a dive hose, and jumped off the
back of the boat. But he neglected to take the boat out of gear...

Once freed of the mooring rope, the spinning prop entangled his hose and
started reeling him in.	 His "lifeline" pulled him through the prop, and
Sharky died on the way to hospital.

Sharky didn't have any children (that he knew of) but he did have a wicked
sense of humour. I hope he forgives me for submitting him for a Darwin
Award!	He died doing what he always did... having a go.
