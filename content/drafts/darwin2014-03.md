(17 July 2014, Poland) In the small town of Karcz&oacute;wka (160
residents) tragedy struck as seven people accidentally drowned in a
cesspool, one after another. The first death was that of a driver whose job
was to empty the septic tank into a slurry tank attached to a tractor; he
succumbed to highly toxic hydrogen sulfide fumes and lost consciousness,
falling into the pool. Following him were six people, each going to the
rescue of those who had gone before, and each in turn falling unconscious
into the muck and drowning. Fully 5% of the population of Karcz&oacute;wka
was lost in this serial misadventure. An eighth person found in the muck
did survive, thanks to the assistance of emergency workers.

The incident occurred on a hog farm and probably involved large amounts
sewage from the pigs, although details are not clear in news reports.

Gather ye rosebuds while you may,<BR>
Old Time is still a-flying,<BR>
And this same flower that smiles today,<BR>
Tomorrow will be dying.<BR>

<FONT size=-1><B>Reader Comments:</B> "You think you'd learn after the
first 2..3...4....5....." "Apparently there was a queue of 157 more people
lined up ready to help, it was only the fact that the cesspool had no more
space that this tragedy finally came to an end." " They couldn't swim, but
they went through the motions." "Rest in Pee" "Slurry tank accidents are
very dangerous and the worst thing is you don't even know until you're
dead." "Sounds like Lemmings." "Don't take life seriously, it's not like
you will get out alive!" "C'est la merde." "Muck to Do about Nothing"</FONT>

<B>DARWIN NOTES: Four of the deceased were related to one another. Some
people who commented on this Award consider it a tragedy. </B> They say
that rescuing family members is heroism, and laud the human instinct to
disregard risk.	 They say, "Not! Funny!" Several expressed the viewpoint
that those who died possess the very genes they would like to see passed
on to future generations.

<B>Rebuttal viewpoints expressed are that the sewage trailer driver was
foolish to succumb to the "rotten egg gas." </B> And whereas the first
would-be rescuer was perhaps acting heroically, after that it became
increasingly foolish to walk to one's death behind the guy in front who
just walked to his death. The final word was this: "The genes I want to
see passed on belong to the person who came upon the scene and had the good
sense to say, hmm, looks like something dangerous is happening here..."
