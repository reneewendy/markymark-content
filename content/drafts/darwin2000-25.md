Duct tape has a reputation for fixing any problem. Steven <!-- Steven Bruce Fuller --> and a friend were fishing in a 12-foot aluminum boat held together with multiple duct tape repairs, including the motor mount. Suddenly they encountered rough water and Steven stood up in the boat.

The vessel, rated to hold 200 pounds, capsized and tossed the two men and their 640 pounds of equipment into the water.
	 <P align="left">The US Coast Guard rescued the surviving companion on Tuesday morning, but Steven was not so lucky. He was found dead in an ill-fitting life jacket. Perhaps if he had duct taped it in place, he would still be sailing the river in his rickety dinghy, instead of holding a Darwin Award.
