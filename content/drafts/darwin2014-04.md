Double Darwin Award!<BR> So many train deaths, the editors
are <I>railing</I> against stupidity.

(2 March 2014, Netherlands) Two intoxicated men dared each other to test
their courage against an intercity train at a Rotterdam train station. At
1800 hours on a Sunday evening, the station was crowded with more than 300
fans returning from a soccer-match pitting Feyenoord against Ajax at <B>De
Kuip</B>, the most beautiful soccer stadium in Holland.

The two men stepped off the platform and strode forth onto the tracks. One
superdaredevil lay down between the tracks, intending to prove that the
entire train would pass over him. What a story to tell! His friend was less
confident and he merely knelt down next to the track and kept his head as
close as possible to where he thought the train's profile would be. Turns
out that the 130 km/h train that came down the track some seconds later was
both lower and wider than they thought. They were killed instantly.

The 300+ onlookers on the platform were none too pleased by the spectacle,
and train traffic was interrupted for several hours while authorities
cleaned up the mess.
