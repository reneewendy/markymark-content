(5 May 2018, Odisha, India) Driving home from a wedding, Prabhu Bhatara
idled the car on the roadside to relieve himself in the woods. From a
squatting position he spied an INJURED bear--but instead of calling the
authorities to help the bear, he opted to get a #selfie with the distressed
animal.

Meanwhile, instead of intervening, the passengers in his car pulled out
their mobiles and filmed the carnage...

As he neared the bear, the passengers advised him against his plan.
Mr. Bhatara, however, was determined to fulfill his selfie mission. Once he
was within reaching distance, though, the bear was not as injured as it
seemed (or it was just having a bad hair day) and lunged forward, pinning
Mr. Bhatara to the ground, "killing him on the spot," according to Forest
ranger Dhanurjaya Mohapatra.

Then, perhaps disgusted at this epic display of homo-sapien apathy, a stray
dog joined the fray in an attempt to save the man, and tried to fight off
the bear! The bear, however, seemed to believe that the world had one too
many selfie-seeking humans and finished off poor Mr. Bhatara.

According to media reports, once the body was retrieved, forest officials
treated the bear for its injuries. The dog, although probably still
disgusted, was unharmed.
