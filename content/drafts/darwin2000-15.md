Shawn traveled from Calistoga to the Oakland Coliseum, and was enjoying the show, except for one little problem. He was dissatisfied with his seat in the top row of the stadium. He climbed a 7-foot wall to gain a better view of the stage - only to inadvertently discover a new seat three stories below.

The group he had traveled to the concert with had no idea he was missing, until the show ended and the police began asking questions. That's when they learned that Shawn had mistaken a curtain for a solid wall, leaned back, and fallen to his death on an escalator 100 feet below.

A police spokesman said the site of the accident was "a good place to obtain a better view." <!-- Shawn Stubblefield, 36, Healdsburg -->

<A href="mailto:REMOVE-jfriedemann@fozlaw.com">John Friedemann, Esq.</A> says, &quot;You have been falsely informed about this tragic death. I&nbsp;represent the victim's father and mother in a wrongful death claim against the Oakland Coliseum Authority (and others) and would be happy to provide you with the actual facts. The&nbsp;wall behind his seat was only about waist high to anyone standing on the seat and the wall is commonly used as a seat by fans. The heavy tarp behind the wall was supposed to have been fastened to the wall to prevent this kind of tragedy, but the job was never completed. I will send a copy of the complaint if you would like.&quot;
