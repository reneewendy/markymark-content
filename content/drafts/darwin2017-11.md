(5 September 2017, California) Fun-loving Cody Horn's last act was to pilot
a <strong>golf cart <em>towed by garden hose</em></strong> behind a vehicle
on State Highway 4, east of Angels Camp. The golf cart swerved across the
double yellow line and directly into the path of a Ford truck, causing a
head-on collision that instantly killed the 28-year-old.

Beloved and hard-working Mr. Horn left many friends behind when he drove
himself out of this life. No reason for the <em>garden-hose golf-cart</em>
adventure has been determined -- probably it was intended to be a harmless
prank.

Mr. Horn was loved by many, and we bring his premature death to the
attention of our readers as a cautionary tale of a silly prank gone too
far. Be safe, folks! Do not cross that line -- the double yellow line --
when planning your own out-of-the-box adventures.
