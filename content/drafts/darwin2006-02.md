(August 2006, Libreville, Gabon) During an impassioned sermon, a
congregation was surprised to hear their 35-year old pastor insist that one
could literally walk on water, if one had enough faith. His words were
big and bold. He extolled the heavenly power possessed by a faithful man
with such force that he may well have convinced himself.

Whether or not he believed in his heart, his speech only left room for
shame should he leave his own faith untested. Thus, the fiery pastor set
out to walk across a major estuary, along the path of a 20-minute ferry
ride. Even though he could not swim.

Lacking the miraculous powers of David Copperfield, let alone Jesus Christ,
this ill-fated cleric found only a damp Darwin Award at the end of his
chosen path.

A related Personal Account from Palorca, Portugal: "I met an elder
villager who once tried to walk on water. He strapped small floaters to
his feet. He floated, all right, but upside down, head submerged.
He was rescued by the spectators." <A
