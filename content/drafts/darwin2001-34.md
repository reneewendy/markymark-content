(12 October 2001, Finland) A group of friends was stranded beside the freeway when their automobile ran out of gas. The weather was terrible, and despite their frantic efforts, nobody would stop to help them. Eventually one member of the group became so frustrated that he stomped to the middle of the freeway and sprawled out across the road.

His friends tried to get him to move, but he yelled back, "I could sleep here..." He was hit by an Audi sports car and dragged 60 meters to his death.

The police found several empty beer bottles lying around the car. We can only hope the 21-year-old was drunk enough to dull the pain of the impact.
