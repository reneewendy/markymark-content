(4 July 2000, Alberta, Canada) Yet another man has shot himself in the groin, greatly reducing his chance of contributing to the gene pool. This particular example of a common miscalculation happened at a Billiards room in Calgary. The 34-year-old man had been involved in an argument at 4am, and came back to settle the score, according to Calgary Police Inspector John Middleton-Hope. "(as) he pulled a small-caliber handgun from his waistband... it discharged." The man, described by his wife as distraught, was taken to a hospital for treatment. His injuries weren't life-threatening, "but I would suggest they were life-altering," said the Inspector.
