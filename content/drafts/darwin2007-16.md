(October 2007, UK) John, 71, used wood and rope to make a traction device
to ease his wife's neck pain. But applying traction to the neck takes a
delicate touch.	 His DIY (do-it-yourself) medical device turned out to be a
gallows, as John found out when he tested it and hanged himself.

The Coroner's verdict: Death by Misadventure. <!-- John Burton, 71 -->

<I>Darwin says, "Story is UNCONFIRMED: the lurid online source is not a
bastion of responsible reporting. However, if it can be confirmed, it's an
apt nominee."</I>
