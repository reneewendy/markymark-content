(October 2002, Norway) It's a well-known fishing trick. Put 12V electrodes into the ground if you want worms come to the surface. One 23-year-old Laagendalsposten man withdrew his genes form the pool when he tried to speed up the process. He figured that 220V, 50Hz, would bring more worms out faster, and he decided to test his theory. Alas, he did so squatting on a steel bucket, one hand holding an electrode while the other was embedded in the ground a few feet away. He seemed determined to enter the eternal fishing grounds. Quicker than spit, that wish was granted. Our Darwin winner leaves only parents -- and no offspring -- back by the earthly creek.
