Woman attempts to make a bigger ass of herself -- and succeeds.

(26 March 2001, Florida) Many women try to reduce the size of their posteriors, but a few scrawnier specimens attempt the opposite. After exhausting a range less invasive home remedies such as wearing padded layers of underwear, a 53-year-old Fort Lauderdale woman persuaded an unlicensed underground "plastic surgeon" to boost her butt size by pumping it full of silicone in the comfort of her own living room. Hospital officials contacted police to report the suspicious death of the needle-marked woman, who had been delivered to the emergency room by rescue workers after suffering breathing difficulties in her apartment. <!-- Vera Lawrence, 53 -->
