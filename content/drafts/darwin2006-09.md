<I>"Rock and Roll will never&nbsp;die."</I>

<P>(17 November 2006, Singapore) Picture a college dorm room. Dirty
laundry, sexy posters, food wrappers, textbooks, and in the middle of it
all, a 16-year-old male rocking out to loud music. A typical student, a
typical day.

<P>But this particular student, rocking out on his air guitar, was about to
"take things too far," according to the coroner's report. Li Xiao, a
student at the Hua Business School, bounced up and down on his bed with
such enthusiasm that he rocked himself right out of the third-floor window.

Normally the windows are locked, but students reportedly force the locks so
they can sneak a cigarette. Perhaps alluding to Ted Nugent's rock song, the
court ruled it a case of "Death By Misadventure." <!-- Li Xiao Meng -->
