(31 May 2003, Indiana) Tamar came all the way from New York for the annual
Stark Raven Mad event at the Splashin' Safari waterpark at Holiday World,
where members of the American Coaster Enthusiasts planned to rendezvous on
Memorial Day weekend. The 32-year-old eagerly looked forward to riding the
Raven, later described by Spencer County Prosecutor Jon Dartt as "one of
the world's most terrifying roller coasters."

Tamar planned what coaster enthusiasts call "catching airtime," standing up
during the ride to show bravery. The park staff warned the "spirited and
intelligent" Harvard MBA, along with the rest of the group, "Don't mess
with our safety equipment." Tamar's seat belt and lap bar restraint were
in place when the train left the station. But you can't catch airtime that
way. Her seatbelt was later found unbuckled and tucked into the seat
cushions.

As the train swooped over the precipice into the "infamous drop" on the fifth
turn at 60 mph, where the G-forces are notoriously skyward, Tamar unlatched her
seat belt and stood up.	 The train dropped, but Tamar didn't. She caught good
air until she landed on the ground, 69 feet below. <!-- Tamar Fellner -->

<B>A reader</B> says, "The park allowed people to ride without properly
pushing down the restraints. This has been a topic of discussion on
several <A

coaster discussion boards.</A>	I had been to two different coaster events
there, and the ride ops were allowing the behavior I mentioned.	 There is
no hard evidence that Tamar was standing. The part of the ride she fell
from is located in the woods, far from the midway, and no one could see her
at that point on the ride."

<B>Darwin replies,</B> "I'm skeptical about your statement. Roller coaster
parks are sticklers for safety, and particularly with a group of boisterous
coaster fans, they would be careful to engage the safety restraints. The
seatbelt was found unbuckled and TUCKED INTO THE CUSHION. I think Tamar
does merit a Darwin Award, for her role in defeating the safeties."

<B>Another reader</B> adds, "It's about her family trying to sue the amusement park. <A HREF="http://www.rollercoasterworld.com/News.htm">This link</A> provides further response."
