(19 May 2014, Arizona) The mummified remains of a man discovered in a
Tucson manhole tell their own poignant story. In May the manhole was
opened to investigate a fluctuation in electrical power. According to
records kept by Tucson Electric Power the manhole had not been opened in
the past five years, so the team that entered the underground high-voltage
vault was quite surprised to find the dessicated remains of a man slumped
near cut copper wires.	In his shriveled hand was -- can you guess? -- a
bolt cutter.

Crime pays so little, and costs so much. This nominee not only failed and
fried but also, nobody noticed, making his death both stupid and sad. An
autopsy confirmed the obvious conclusion that electrocution was the likely
cause of death.	 The date of death was set at somewhere between one and two
years previous to the discovery.

The mummy was carrying ID for a 51-year-old man, and DNA testing is
underway to verify the identiy of the crispy copper critter.
