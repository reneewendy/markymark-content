(27 July 2017, Singapore) In a new twist on, "Hold my beer and watch this!" a teen handed Snapchat to a friend and with a whoop of glee he leapt over a foot-bridge railing, intending to land dramatically on a parapet below. Unknown to the teen or his filming friend, the seemingly solid shade was flimsy <I>gypsum board</I> and he crashed right through, falling four floors to his death.

The Snapchat phenomenon is extending the e-trend of paying inadequate attention to one's physical surroundings, and the act earns a Darwin Award indeed. We are saddened by the death of this young and personable student, but our sadness would do disservice to the deceased if it caused us to hush up his fatal prank. State Coroner Marvin Bay agrees, stating that "Mr. Chow's sad demise should serve as a cautionary tale for individuals who are disposed to off-route in public spaces.

Jonathan, you're a winner!"

"We were window shopping for clothes at the mall<BR>
when he came up with the stunt," said his friend, <BR>
"I was just like a female version of him."
