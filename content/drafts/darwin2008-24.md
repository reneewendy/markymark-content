(9 October 2008, South Africa) For days, Johannesburg office workers
watched a demolition worker slowly chip away at a pillar supporting the
concrete slab above him. One said, "I wondered how they would drop that
section." The walls were gone, and only the supporting pillars remained.

Dozens of observers watched the slow and senseless demolition
proceed. Finally the only possible outcome concluded this epic battle. The
besieged support collapsed, crushing man and machine beneath a pile of
rubble. Ishmael M., 52, was killed instantly inside the cab of his
mini-excavator.

Observers said they had been concerned about the workers' safety for
several days. "I cannot believe they did not foresee this," said a shocked
witness who did not forsee this. "There was no common sense!"
