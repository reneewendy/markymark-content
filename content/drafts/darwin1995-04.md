align="right" border=0></A>URBAN LEGEND!	The Arizona Highway Patrol
were mystified when they came upon a pile of smoldering wreckage
embedded in the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of
a curve. The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash,
but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The
make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene.

<P align="left"> The folks in the lab finally figured out what it
was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise.

<P align="left">It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow
got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid
fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra
push for take-off from short airfields.

	 <P align="left">Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for
breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the
JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch
of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated
to a high speed, and fired off the rocket.
	 <P align="left">The facts, as best as
could be determined, are as follows:

<P align="left">The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He
ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash
site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched
and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of
between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full
power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot
experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks
under full afterburners.

<P align="left">The Chevy remained on the straight highway for
approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the
brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick
rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne
for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of
125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock.

<P align="left">Most of the driver's remains were not recovered;
however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from
the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece
of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.

<P align="left">Ironically a still-legible bumper sticker was found,
reading <BR> &quot;How do you like my driving? Dial
1-800-EAT-SHIT.&quot;

<P align="left"><B>This Darwin Award is the most popular of all
time. </B>Considered true for years, it was later debunked as an
Urban Legend by the <A
href="http://www.dps.state.az.us/news/nr96006.htm">Arizona&nbsp;Department
of&nbsp;Public&nbsp;Safety</A>. The story fooled the judges in 1995,
and JATO has been grandfathered in as a Darwin Award Winner. Officer
Bob Stein of the Arizona Department of Public Safety receives
"inquiries several times a day about accidents, drug busts,
investigations we are conducting.	 Two years ago, I picked up the
phone and researched the answer to what has become an Arizona myth.
Even after all this time, I&nbsp;still receive about five calls a
month from people wanting to know, did it really happen?&quot;

notoriety were his identity known today.	Several claim ownership of
the idea of strapping a jet engine onto a vehicle. Read this

</A>says, &quot;Baffles me why anyone would believe the JATO story,
because it's physically implausible. Attaching a modern JATO to an
automobile so that it will not tear free on firing would be a
remarkable engineering feat. Anyone smart enough to accomplish that,
would also be smart enough to be nowhere near when the JATO is fired!
Leaving that aside, as long as the car stays on the ground, the
wheels would have sufficient friction to keep the motion straight,
although they would probably lack the traction to maintain
stability. Once the contraption became airborne, there would be
NOTHING to stabilize the flight. Those doodads on airplanes like
wings and tail assemblies are not only for style, but to keep the
aircraft level. An airborne automobile propelled by an attached JATO
would slam nose down into the ground in very short order.&quot;

	 <P><A href="mailto:REMOVE-Orphiucus@aol.com">Orphiucus</A>
says: "This reminds me of a colleague's
reminiscence, which may be the basis of the JATO story. He was a military pilot In the 50's in Guam, when two men strapped not one but two
JATO engines to the back of a military Jeep. They took it to Guam's 3-mile
airstrip and
ignited the engines, which hurled them 200 yards down the runway
before the Jeep, now travelling at more than 300 mph,
disintegrated. The men were shredded to bits, and the engines broke
free from the remains of the jeep and darted wildly around the base
before burning out. A film of this incident
exists, in a military archive or maybe in a shoebox in someone's attic. "

	 <P><B>Scott McClave</B> says:	 "Andy Granitelli ran the legendary STP Indy car
racing teams of the 60's and 70's. This tale is from his book, They
Call Me Mister 500. Granitelli had experimented with strapping a
JATO rocket to a car back in the late 40's. They first tried just one JATO rocket attached to an open-wheel hot rod, with
little success. (Later they discovered that the first rocket was a
dud.) Thinking they needed more power, they tied multiple JATO
rockets to a single start button. Fortunately for Granetelli, only
one rocket fired, which still propelled the car well over 150
mph. That was enough to convince him to stop experimenting with JATO rockets. Why did Grantelli survive to tell the
story? Because the JATO of the 40's was
first-generation, designed to lift a single-engine Navy bomber
off the deck of an aircraft carrier. The JATO rocket of today has
significantly more thrust, and is typically used to lift
a large four-engine C-130 transport off a short, primitive
runway. A car just can't keep the modern rocket on the
ground."</P>
