(14 January 2007, West Virginia) Raising a new barn is an endeavor that
brings a community together. Demolishing a barn is another question. A
trio of friends set out to dismantle a dilapidated structure one bracing
winter afternoon. Speaking of bracing...

It was all fun and games until one industrious fellow fired up his chainsaw
and ripped through a crucial support post. Carrying the weight of a full
barn roof, those wooden beams were all that stood between the demolition
worker and structural collapse.

The roof succumbed to the pull of gravity, and the ill-fated lumberjack had
a few brief moments to contemplate the approach of his deadly problem.	As
a consolation prize, the deceased was indeed successful at demolishing the
barn. <!-- Tony B. Michael, 34 -->
