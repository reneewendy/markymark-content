(18 December 2005, South Africa) Two muggers were working a crowd. The had
just taken a cellphone and purse from a couple at knifepoint, when the
woman screamed. The muggers sprinted away. But working a crowd and working
out are entirely different things, and one of the muggers was out of shape.

As he watched his compatriot recede into the distance, he felt the stitch
