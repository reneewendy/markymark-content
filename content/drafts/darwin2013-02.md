The dead guy featured here was well loved, and an
awesome <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheLeeHalpinHumanRightsMemorial/">'Human
Rights Memorial' FB page</a> was created in his honor. He was a great guy
who won a Darwin Award shortly after his death in 2013, for dying of
hypothermia while pretending to be homeless. But should that nomination be
rescinded? Review the new information.

(31 March 2013, Newcastle, England) Investigative journalism reached a
hypothermic "low" when a 26-year-old reporter apparently froze to death
while sleeping rough. He was on a quest to experience and understand the
life of an unhoused person in England. A form of investigative journalism
intended to advance his career.

Waving aside the concerns of friends and family, he declared, "I will sleep
rough, scrounge for food, interact with as many homeless people as
possible, and immerse myself in that lifestyle deeply." And so he set out
with a sleeping bag, and immersed himself for three days -- before waking
up dead in a boarded-up hostel.

Darwin Award winner, right?

But wait! Later a post-mortem was released. The coroner could not
determine any cause of death, referring to the event as 'Sudden Adult Death
Syndrome.' Hmm. On the one hand, it makes sense that living rough for (3)
days figured into his death at only 26. OTOH the coroner did not confirm
that common-sense idea.

Investigative journalism--gonzo journalism--is an important way of
understanding the lives of an estimated 2,300 people sleeing rough each
night (according to Crisis.co.uk 2013). It is socially worthwhile for a
journalist to embark on a live-in-their-shoes mission.

Also, the journalist was assisted by two 'cameramen' who filmed in shifts.
He was not completely alone on his quest, and he had even teamed up with
two actual homeless men who helped him figure it out. In fact, the two men
unlucky enough to be in the vicinity and were arrested 'on suspicion.'

They were later released. So what I want to know is, Is this death a
Darwin Award or an unforseeable accidental death? I've re-set the vote
count on this one. Let me know.
