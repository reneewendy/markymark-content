(2 February 2008, New York) A 50-year-old man was bird hunting in Upstate
New York with his buddies and his faithful canine companion. They stopped
for a smoke, and his dog found a deer leg bone!

The man tried to take the bone away, but like any right thinking dog, the
animal would not relinquish its treasure. He stayed just out of reach.
Frustrated with this blatant show of disobedience, the man grabbed his
loaded shotgun by the muzzle and began wielding it like a club.	 Each time
he swung it, the dog dodged.

Suddenly the "club" struck the ground and fired, shooting the man in the
abdomen. He was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he died from his
injuries. He did remain conscious long enough to confirm this account to
police; otherwise, his poor friends might now be under suspicion!

At least he didn't hit the dog.
