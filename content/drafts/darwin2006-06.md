(17 April 2006, England) There's always someone who thinks good advice
doesn't apply to him. For example, if a doctor advises that you are going
to be covered with a flammable medical treatment, most people would take
this advice onboard, and not strike a match until the flammable material
has been removed.

Philip was in the hospital to treat a skin disease, said treatment
consisting of being smeared in paraffin-based cream. Philip was warned
that the cream could ignite, so he definitely should NOT smoke.	 However,
Phillip, 60, knew better than his doctor. And he just <A
href="http://www.tobacco.org/History/Smoke_Cigarette.html">had to have
another cigarette.</A>

Smoking was not permitted on the ward, but Phillip took this setback in
stride and sneaked out onto a fire escape. Once he was hidden, he lit
up... inhaled... and peace descended as he got his nicotine fix. It was
only after he finished his cigarette, at the moment he ground out the butt
with his heel, that things went downhill.

The paraffin cream had been absorbed by his clothing. As his heel touched
the butt, fumes from his pyjamas ignited. The resulting inferno "cremated"
his skin condition, and left first-degree burns on much of his body.
Despite excellent treatment, he died in intensive care.

Using the Darwin checklist:

1.Reproduction -- he may have children, but he won't have more.<BR>
2.Excellence -- this one I'll remember!<BR>
3.Self-Selection -- he was warned that paraffin and smoking don't mix.<BR>
4.Maturity -- at 60 I guess he was old enough.<BR>
5.Veracity -- major UK news carriers covered the story.

This ticks all the boxes, and though I feel sorry for the family, his death
serves as a warning to others.	If a doctor tells you not to smoke, there's a
very good reason.
