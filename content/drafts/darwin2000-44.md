(11 October 2000, Itim) The violent unrest in the Middle East has created a new Darwin Award winner. Alon and two friends went to the Eli junction to enjoy throwing stones at passing cars. They scored on a passing truck, then Alon walked into the street, stones in hand, to attack a passing car. The driver tried to swerve away from the stones, lost control of his car, and overturned, killing the stone thrower and severely injuring the driver. Judea and Samaria District police determined that the accidental crash was caused by the stone-throwing.
<!-- Alon Zargri, 28, deceased Eli settler, and driver Khaled Ibrahim Madani, 35, from Nablus -->

"Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones."
