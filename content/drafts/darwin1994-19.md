The private pilot and a pilot rated passenger [two pilots] were going to
practice simulated instrument flight. Witnesses observed the airplane's
right wing fail in a dive and crash. Examination of the wreckage and bodies
revealed that both occupants were partially clothed and the front right
seat was in the full aft reclining position. [The pilots had converted the
co-pilot seat to a bed.] Neither body showed evidence of seatbelts or
shoulder harnesses being worn. [They were lying on the bed.] Examination of
the individuals' clothing revealed no evidence of ripping or distress to
the zippers and belts. [Their lack of clothing seemed to be voluntary.]

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s)
of this accident as follows:

The pilot in command's improper in-flight decision to divert her attention
to other activities not related to the conduct of the flight. [The pilot
and co-pilot were having sex, and nobody was flying the plane.]
Contributing to the accident was the exceeding of the design limits of the
airplane leading to a wing failure. [The lack of a pilot caused the plane
to fly erratically, over-stressing the wing and leading to a crash.]
