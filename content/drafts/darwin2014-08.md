(17 September 2014, Pakistan) Two correspondents nominated the
gullible acolyte who volunteered to be killed and resurrected by a holy
man--and not a holy man who was <B>experienced</B> with the procedure, but a
beginner who thought he'd give it a whirl!

For five years a popular Sufi had been performing miracles for villagers in
Mubarakabad. Now he was ready to increase the stakes to a full
resurrection. But he was not interested reviving any old corpse--the
novice naturally preferred to breathe life back into fresh meat. So the
Sufi put Word out to his followers that he wanted to kill and revive a
faithful man--a faithful married man--a married man with children! The
Sufi seemed to be stacking the deck to resurrect a person with a strong
incentive to return, a person with no desire to malinger in death. And in
the grip of an overwhelmingly obvious Darwin Moment, 40-year-old Muhammad
Niaz stepped up and volunteered to be murdered the very next day.

Lest anyone claim that Muhammad was mentally ill, which would disqualify
him from a Darwin Award, please remember that resurrection by saints is an
idea that is popular in Christianity as well. Bible verse Matthew 10:8
says that Jesus commanded his acolytes, <I>"Heal the sick, <B>raise the
dead,</B> cleanse lepers, cast out demons," </I> and Catholic saints have
been recorded as performing the miracle of raising the dead.

On Tuesday the idea was announced, on Wednesday the follower was killed,
and on Thursday the overly optimistic Sufi was behind bars for murder.
Generally no Darwin Awards are given for murder, but in this case the
acolyte volunteered for the scheme and earned his just reward.
