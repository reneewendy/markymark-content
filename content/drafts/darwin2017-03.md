(25 March 2017, Mexico) Women are underrepresented in the Darwin Awards. We
hope readers appreciate this cautionary true account. One fine day Nirvana
and Corral (pseudonyms) went off to see the horse races. They were excited
to be at the racetrack in the Sovereign State of Chihuahua.

The races were held on a track adjacent to an airfield runway. Spectators
arrived in vehicles and in planes. After the races, Corral (18) and
Nirvana (17) wanted to share a selfie online&mdash;as one does. In order to
selfie the racetrack scene, they needed to gain elevation.

But horses race on flatlands. Airfields are built on flatlands. The
highest spot was on top of a vehicle parked alongside
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-towered_airport">uncontrolled
airfield runway.</a>

They chose the highest platform they could-- a flatbed truck or a van-- and
climbed to the top. Accounts differ on the specific vehicle, but agree
that the women did not have permission.

Posing and smiling, paying no attention to their surroundings, they were
taking a big risk by becoming the highest points at this rural
airfield. According to news reports, the noise of the crowd drowned out the
noise of a descending aircraft, and the wing of the aircraft struck and
killed them instantly.

Tragedy Of The Selfie.

Personally I do mourn the deaths of two lively young
people. But I also expect this will serve as a warning to other younger
folks. Please share this regrettable Public Service Announcement.
