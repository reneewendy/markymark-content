Darwin says, "RIDE'EM COWGIRL -- <I>is it a Darwin Award or just
bad driving? Sure, we all love the rare Lady Darwin Winner, and you can
reeead this one, but I'm not sure about it. The passenger, for instance,
why should he get dinged for driving without a license?	 He was only
steering the car out of a disaster course. For those who like to comment</I>

A cautionary tale for those who can't spare the time to slow down and do things properly.

14 August 2010, Kentucky | Kelita H. was travelling "at highway speed" in
her Chevy, cruising down Country Road 519 with the wind blowing through her
hair, when she and her passenger decided to swap seats.	 In this situation,
a less hasty person would stop the car for a "Chinese fire drill" but
Kelita was a little more creative than that. Fortunately, you see, her car
had an open T-Top.

She stood up, pulled herself onto the roof, and she fell. And then Kelita
was travelling solo "at highway speed" down that country road.

The Fayette County Coroner's Office reported that the 20-year-old died from
injuries sustained while impacting a guardrail.

On the way down, her foot hit the steering wheel and the car veered
left--but the passenger, who was still inside the vehicle, grabbed the
wheel and averted his own possible demise, thereby demonstrating the wisdom
of learning from the mistakes of others. That passenger, by the way,
easily earns an Honorable Mention himself, as he was arrested and charged
with driving on a suspended license with improper registration and no
insurance.

There are several lessons to learn here.
