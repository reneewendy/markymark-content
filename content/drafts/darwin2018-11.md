(5 August 882, France) A powerful ruler is not immune to the consequences
of his actions. Over 1,000 years ago, Louis III ruled West Francia for
three short years--a brief reign marked by military success. King Louie
conquered new tracts of territory, and he defeated Viking raiders, but
alas! Despite amazing success, amazing loss soon followed.

On a fine autumn day in Saint-Denis, France, the king glimpsed a beautiful
woman he needed to woo and pursue. On horseback he chased her! Clearly not
seeing where he was headed, he whacked his royal skull on an innocent door
lintel. The coup d'&eacute;tat, a fatal blow! His cranium fractured, King
Louis III died to teach us an important life lesson.

Be careful!! When blindly following innate desires, the world can "crash
down upon your head" in the space of one overzealous woo.
