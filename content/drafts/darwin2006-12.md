(Wisconsin) A patrol officer came to speak to our Drivers' Education class about safety. Like all such officers, he came with several cautionary tales, and the irony of this one stayed with me.

In a town down the road, seven college kids decided to raise a little ruckus after a party. They all piled into a pickup, one in the cab and the rest in the back, and they drove down deserted backroads pulling stop signs out of the dirt. The goal was to get as many as possible into the truck. Speeding back to the party, they were struck by a delivery vehicle at--you guessed it--an intersection which had, until recently, sported a safety marker.

The six in the back of the truck were killed, and the driver was badly injured. The patrol officer said he would never forget the sight of the dead students sprawled at the wreck, surrounded by twenty-seven stop signs.

Darwin says, <I>"A tragic demise. Anyone with confirmation, please contact
