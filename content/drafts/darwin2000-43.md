<A href="/art/banwell/" target="_top"><IMG src="/i/art/banwell/darwin2000-43.gif" width="200" height="269" align="right" border="0"></A>(27 July 2000, Phnom Penh) A motorcycle taxi driver challenged his neighbor to stand beneath a hornets' nest, while two men pelted it with stones. The 53-year old man should have known better, but he had a local reputation as a strong man' to uphold. He stood beneath the nest and the pelting commenced. The man endured the pain of countless stinging hornets before expiring from the toxic injections. Apparently he was not as strong as he thought.
