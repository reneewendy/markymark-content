(22 Feb 2009, Devon, UK) Location: A seaside town, a coastal trail.
Fencing was in place to protect people from falling off the path, but this
protective barrier was no match for the allure of a feather blown by the
breeze. . .just out of reach. A woman in her forties climbed that fence
and chased the elusive feather right off a seaside cliff.

There was no cure for what ailed her--she died of head injuries the
following day.
