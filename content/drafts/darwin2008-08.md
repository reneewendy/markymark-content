(8 March 2008, Czech Republic) Steel is valuable, especially high-quality
alloy used in steel cable. Scrap metal dealers ask no questions and pay in
cash. And a good supply of steel cable can be found in elevator shafts.
These facts focused our man on a particular gold mine - er, steel mine -
located in an empty granary near Zatec, forty miles northwest of Prague.

The silo housed a grain elevator. Its massive cable was tightly tethered
to the floor and its upper end disappeared into the shadowy space above.
After substantial wear and tear on a hacksaw, our man cut through the
bottom end of the strong steel cable! At that instant...

... The counterweight, no longer held in check, began to accelerate
silently downward and quickly reached the bottom of the shaft. Result: One
Winner of a "Terminal Velocity" Darwin Award! -- R.I.P. to this unnamed
steel tycoon.
