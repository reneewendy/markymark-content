is the peculiar wit of lying flat as a plank in unusual locations--train
tracks, fire hydrants, clotheslines--and posting public photographs,
spreading joy. This Australian craze had infected poor Mr. Acton B., a
(former) planking enthusiast who was not aware that <U><A href=/cgi/search.pl?keywords=balcony&maxresults=40&swishindex=darwin.data&swishindex=stupid.data&swishindex=legend.data&swishindex=personal.data&show_description=yes>Balconies Are The #1

PLANKING happened on 15 May 2011, Brisbane AU.	Although we do not have a
photograph of the actual event, we encourage reporters to re-enact the
scene for your own cameras. No, really, go ahead.<P>

cruisers, planking here, there, and across the desks on TV Network News.
Planking has well and truly <A href=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/has-joel-spolsky-jumped-the-shark.html>jumped the shark.</A>

READER COMMENTS: <BR>
"Natural selection nudged him over the line, and he fell..."<BR>
"Planking is bound to remove people from the gene pool."<BR>
Please be careful where you plank! :)<BR>
Watch out for balconies :-)<BR>

"You will enjoy this. They are truly dark and hilarious. Your dad didn't
quite get the wharped sense of humor that one needs to enjoy this. Maybe he
was tired...Love, Gma Carolina"

"O site dos burros pra carai!"<BR>
"Blessedly he was not naked."<BR>
"As promised funny (but dark). From the vault of the always amusing Darwin
Awards."
