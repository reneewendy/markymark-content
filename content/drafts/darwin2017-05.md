(April 2017, Argentina) "Divine punishment," said the judge, deciding not
to imprison a man who shot himself in the testicles while carrying an
illegal weapon in his waistband. The man lost his family jewels, his job as
a security guard, and was faced with years in prison until the court
ruled that he had been punished enough by a higher authority. Instant karma?

Reported widely in two major newspaper, Clar&iacute;n and La Nacion, tact
requires us to withhold the name of this Living Darwin Award Winner. Jobs
are scarce in the man's town within Buenos Aires, and the unregistered
45-caliber Colt pistol had been given to him as part of his security job,
creating a tragedy within a tragedy.

The shooting occurred about two years ago. The final court decision
occurred in April 2017. Although this was reported on April 1st, my
contact <A href=https://www.facebook.com/absolutpatagonia>Luis
Burgue&ntilde;o</A> assures me that Argentina celebrates Fools Day on
December 28th, <I>el dia de los santos inocentes.</I>
