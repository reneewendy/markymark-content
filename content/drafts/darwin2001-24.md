		<P>(16 July, 2001, United States) An assistant plant
		manager for Blacklidge Emulsions died when he used an
		acetylene torch to cut a hole in a 10,000 gallon tank of
		asphalt emulsion. He was attempting to visually survey the
		amount of emulsion that remained in the tank, but "no
		safety precautions were taken before the cutting operation
		began," stated an OSHA representative. "[His] attention was
		twice called to a warning sign on the side of the structure
		which stated the contents were combustible. In complete
		disregard of safety procedures," the erstwhile manager "lit
		an acetylene torch and began cutting, causing an explosion
		that blew him 93 feet away.</P>
