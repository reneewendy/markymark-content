(September 2003, Mexico) An unidentified 60-year-old Escobedo man was still
thirsty after drinking what most would consider "too much alcohol." He
stumbled toward a nearby beehive, hoping to follow the beer with a bit of
honey.

He thought the bees would surely share.	 Instead, they obeyed a Darwinian
signal bred into them for millennia. Over a thousand noble fighters gave
their all, sacrificed their stingers and their lives to protect the hive.
The man, quite reasonably, responded with terminal anaphylactic shock.

A hospital spokesman disputed the theory that bees had killed him,
attributing his demise to, "the stupid things drunken people do," and
pointing out that he was otherwise healthy and would have enjoyed a long
life. "The combination was lethal."

<I>"Bees don't kill people, people kill bees."</I>
