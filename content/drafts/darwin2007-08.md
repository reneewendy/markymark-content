(19 August 2007, Serbia) It's well known that alcohol impairs judgement.
It's well known that carnivorous wild animals and humans don't mix. What
happens when we combine all three? One might expect men, beer, and bears
to combine with lethal consequences. Such was the case for a 23-year old
man who inadvertently fed himself to Masha and Misha at the Belgrade

Serbia | It's well known that alcohol impairs judgement. It's well known
that carnivorous wild animals and humans don't mix. What happens when we
combine all three? One might expect men, beer, and bears to lead to lethal
consequences.

Such was the case for a 23-year old man who fed himself to Masha and Misha
at the Belgrade Zoo. His untouched clothes suggested that he approached the
bears bare-naked by choice. The bears, fearing that his intentions were as
dishonorable as they were ill-informed, meted out a quick justice.

The man's mauled corpse was found inside the bear habitat along with plenty
of beer cans. Masha and Misha "reacted angrily" when keepers tried to
recover the man's corpse, but were eventually persuaded to give up their
prize.

The Zoo director said, "Only an idiot would jump into the bear cage."
