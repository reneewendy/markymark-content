(27 October 2009, Arkansas) Thirty-year-old Ms. Devan-LeAnn of Shongaloo,
Louisiana, was visiting Lake Ehrling with a male friend. Recent bouts of
heavy rain had resulted in a flood of runoff water, and the two decided it
would be "fun" to take a mattress careening down the surging water in the
spillway.

Unfortunately Devan-Leann was riding a foam egg-crate style mattress pad. Imagine
a wet foam pad. Are you sinking yet?

According to her friend, Devan-LeAnn
simply vanished from sight at dusk. The next morning her body was found in
a tangle of trees seventy yards below the spillway.

Parents, warn your children! Wetting the bed <I>can</I> be deadly.
