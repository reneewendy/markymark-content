jinja-title: Stab in the Dark

Unconfirmed by Darwin
jinja-status: draft
(3 December 2000, Australia) A stabbing death of a man in the suburbs of Brisbane was precipitated by a bizarre twist of fate. Two men, aged 21 and 28, went to a caravan park intent on doing serious damage to the occupant of one trailer. In the ensuing confusion, the intended victim escaped without injury while his two attackers managed to viciously stab each other. The 21-year-old knife-wielder died at the scene, while the 28-year-old was hospitalized with severe injuries. The incident thus qualifies for both a Darwin Award and an At-Risk Survivor, a rare event indeed!
