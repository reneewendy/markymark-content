(8 March 2018, New Jersey) A Wanaquer man died in a vehicle fire after he
drove around barricade cones and onto live power wires in Franklin Lakes. A
good son, Anthony G. was en-route to his father's house to shovel the
driveway.

After the second nor'easter storm in a week, hundreds of thousands were
left without power. Utility crews worked overtime to deal with downed trees
and electric lines. Traffic snarls and frustrated motorists were
everywhere.

Anthony did not want to lose time to a detour! According to police, our
winner simply navigated around bright orange traffic cones warning
motorists of a hazardous downed wire on Route 208.

Responding to calls, officers arrived at 9AM to find the vehicle fully
engulfed in flames. A live power line was sputtering in the roadway near
the vehicle. The fire totally gutted the car, and the driver was pronounced
dead at the scene. Ironically this Darwin Award winner was <em>employed as
a New York City electrician.</em>
