(27 July 2007, Guadalajara, Mexico) 24-year-old Jessica was working out in
the Provincia Hotel's gym when she realised she needed something from the
floor below. Instead of picking up the phone, using the intercom, or just
walking downstairs, she decided that the open shaft of the industrial lift
was the communications device for her.

So Jessica stuck her head into the empty shaft to shout to the people
downstairs. And somehow, she missed noticing that the elevator was coming
up towards her.	 If the elevator had been going down, one could say that
she was in no position to observe the approaching lift.	 But, leaving aside
the stupidity of sticking your head into an elevator shaft, if she was
looking down, how could she miss the mass of metal inexorably headed her
way?

Since an elevator cage and a skull are both solid objects, one had to give.
Let's just say, the elevator won. Jessica will be missed by her family,
but not by the gene pool.
