(16 March 2013, Florida) The death of a man who fell down an elevator shaft at Tampa International Airport last year was ruled accidental -- if one considers forcing open the elevator doors, jumping toward the cables, and wrapping your arms and legs around them to slow your descent "an accident." The man lost his grip (friction is a bitch) and fell headfirst down the shaft from the seventh floor, resulting in a quick and painless death: the medical report describes the trauma as "complete dislocation of cervical vertebrae 5 and 6, with spinal cord laceration," meaning he broke his neck.

Pill-popping vodka-swilling Chad Wolfe, 31, was resting in peace (or
"sleeping it off") when the Estate of Chad Wolfe decided to dig up his
grave eighteen months later by filing a lawsuit. Evidently a hanging Chad
demands a legal enquiry. According to the Estate of Chad Wolfe, the cause
of his death was a malfunctioning elevator and airport authorities as well
as the elevator manufacturer should have prevented it.

At the time, Chad was behaving like a impatient drunken gorilla. He was
physically strong; forcing open elevator doors is no problem for a man who
can climb potted plants. He was also high as a kite with the fantastical
belief that he could grab the elevator cables in free-fall and slide down
to the first floor like a movie hero. Eighteen months later Chad is
portrayed as the blameless victim of doors that opened too easily.

It is reasonable that elevator doors should open with a determined effort,
otherwise people are physically trapped inside elevators when the power
fails. It is unreasonable to protect idiots from themselves no matter the
extreme. And idiots are made, not born -- the person in question had
voluntarily swallowed a mix of decision-impairing substances bringing his
BAC to 0.17% with a Xanax chaser. Unfamiliar with Xanax, this writer
thumbed through the Urban Dictionary and found Xanax described as one of
the more addictive benzos with withdrawal effects including psychosis and
epileptic-type seizures.

Summary? A DARWIN AWARD is granted to Chad Wolfe, while
a <A href="http://StellaAwards.com">STELLA AWARD</A> for legal stupidity is
awarded to the Estate of Chad Wolfe.
