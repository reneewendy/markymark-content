(11 March 2000, Perth, Australia) It just stands to reason, one should
follow safe practices while filming a safety video. But the 52-year-old
owner of a machinery and equipment training school violated that rule of
common sense while filming a forklift safety demonstration.

With the cameras rolling, he was thrown from the forklift cabin and
crushed. Subsequent investigation fingered the culprits responsible for the
fatality: driver error and high speed over varied terrain, coupled with an
unused seat belt.

His final safety demonstration was the most convincing of his career. <!--
Peter Victor Caruso, 52 -->
