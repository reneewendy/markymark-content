jinja-title: Snowball's Chance in Hell

Unconfirmed by Darwin

jinja-status: draft
(March, Delaware) Two I-95 toll collectors were involved in a friendly snowball fight when one reached out to scoop some snow from a passing tractor-trailer rig. Manning a tollbooth is not the most interesting job, so it's only natural that collectors would engage in some freestyle entertainment. But scooping snow from a moving vehicle is not the safest of sports. The toll collector's hand caught in the rig, and he was pulled from his booth and dragged to his death.
