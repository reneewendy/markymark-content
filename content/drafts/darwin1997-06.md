21 December 1997, Texas<BR>

A Dallas man who was exposing himself to passing
traffic died Friday night. Police were alerted by a motorist who had
spotted Richard Hollis, 47, standing naked on a railroad trestle. When
officers arrived, Hollis was standing under the trestle, still naked. As
officers approached, he grabbed his clothes and ran back onto the railroad
trestle. He leapt from the trestle, apparently aiming for a concrete
support underneath, but missed and fell 35 feet to the ground. He died at
Parkland hospital an hour later.

15 July 1999, San Francisco<BR>

A drunken 20-year old woman was standing next to the railroad tracks
intending to flash her breasts at the engineer. As the train swept past,
the draft swept her off her feet and under the train, breaking her
elbows. She was charged with a misdemeanor, and died several days later in
the hospital.
