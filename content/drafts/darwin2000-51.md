	 (27 October 2000, Illinois) A splinter group of Jehovah's Witnesses that tests their faith by standing in traffic, lost one of their members when she was struck by a vehicle on Interstate 55 while professing her beliefs to the passing motorists. It was not her first attempt to win converts in the middle of the busy freeway, but it was certainly her last.

		 </FONT></B>&quot;I want to state for the record that there are no splinter groups of Jehovah's Witnesses. To use the name of a major organization in this way is very irresponsible. Jehovah's Witnesses have a high regard for the sanctity of human life and would never encourage anyone to engage in such risky behaviour. This is akin to having several of your employees leave to start a publishing company for the KKK and having someone report that a division of the Darwin Awards was involved in a hate crime. Please be careful with who you are implicating in this.&quot; <FONT size="-1">-Tom Anon</FONT>
