(19 July 2010, Washington) Thanks to Skagit Raceway, the town of
<B>Sedro-Woolley</B> (pop. 10,000) fills with racing folks. During the
American Sprint Car Series, two crew members--smart people with a high
degree of mechanical ability--were working at a custom machine shop when
they dreamed up an unusual thrill ride.	 The men put a a 55-gallon barrel
in the parking lot, poured in <I> four gallons of methanol,</I> sat on top
of the barrel, and lit the bunghole!

<B><A href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&defl=en&q=define:Bung+hole&sa=X&ei=mUJsTMHfJZHmsQOdo_jtBw&ved=0CBIQkAE">"Lit
what?" &nbsp; "Lit the bunghole!" (definition)</B></A></FONT>

Apparently they thought the barrel would skid across the parking lot like a
rocket, with a tail of flame shooting out, and two rodeo clowns sitting on
top waving their caps and wooting! But instead of sliding across the
pavement, well, let's just point out that four gallons of methanol in a
55-gallon drum greatly resembles a bomb.

The barrel blew up beneath them with enough force that the end of the
barrel landed 120 feet away. The two inspired <A
href="http://girlgenius.wikia.com/wiki/Spark">Sparks*</A> landed in
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where one man lost his life. The
other survived with a sobering lesson on the power of internal combustion.

Working on a race car <I>is</I> a bit risky, but this was not a
work-related shop accident. Rather, it was a dangerous and ill-conceived
stunt by two bored men who were hoping to find some fun in a small town.
Dear readers, please learn from the mistakes of others.	 You don't have
time to make them all yourself!

"Apparently it was supposed to slide across the parking lot like a rocket," said the Fire Chief, but instead of a fun little thrill ride, the barrel blew up. The end of the barrel landed 120 feet away from the blast site.
