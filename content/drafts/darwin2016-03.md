(11 December 2016, England) Drop an iPhone into your bath water, no biggie,
all you get is a nasty repair bill. But drop <I>a charging iPhone</I> into
your bathwater...and suddenly coroners are demanding warning labels.

It is with chagrin that this writer, known to bathe while poking at her
laptop keyboard, shares news of the explicable demise of Richard Bull and
his iPhone. Mr. Bull, 32, plugged his charger into an extension cord and
rested the charger on his chest while using the phone in the tub. He
received severe burns on his chest, arm, and hand when the charger touched
the water in his West London home, which mattered little as he was already
dead from heart failure.
<P id="sidebar1">SIDEBAR: "You're vulnerable in the bathroom." A laptop or mobile phone
typically has a low voltage of 5V to 20V so you will not feel anything if
it falls into your bath... as long as it is not charging. If it is
charging up, you are at the mercy of elemental forces, and any safety factors
that may be installed to save you from yourself.

Those of us who plug into plugged-in electronics must heed the coroner's
warning and take a breather in the loo. The sparky mix of electricity and
water is a fact known to all, yet the doctor who conducted the iNquest
plans to send a stern note to Apple. Perhaps one more warning label will
solve our problem?
