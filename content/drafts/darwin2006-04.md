(August 2006, Brazil) August brings us a winner from Brazil, who tried to disassemble a Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) by driving back and forth over it with a car. This technique was ineffective, so he escalated to pounding the RPG with a sledgehammer. The second try worked--in a sense. The explosion proved fatal to one man, six cars, and the repair shop wherein the efforts took place.

Fourteen more RPG were found in a car parked nearby. Police believe the ammunition was being scavenged to sell as scrap metal. If it wasn't scrap then, it certainly is now!

Darwin says, "I have begun to question the merits of landmine
nominations. Many a poor person must take risks to put food on the table. A
reader who cleared mines for many years said, 'These people have little
choice but to scavenge metal to feed their families. It's not stupid
behaviour, although many are killed. A sad state of affairs.' When a poor
person takes risks for his family, he is acting honorably.

"OTOH, slamming a sledgehammer into a mine that is meant to blow a human
being to smithereens--is surely the least best way to salvage metal from
it. Avoiding one's own demise is ALSO of use to the family.

"I am considering eliminating mine scavenging from the Darwin Awards. But
<A href="/darwin/darwin1999-07.html">Fatal Footsie</A> and <A
href="/darwin/darwin2005-01.html">Mining for Elephants</A> are safe from
elimination!"
