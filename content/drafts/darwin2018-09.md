(9 June 2018, Czech Republic) Meteorology showed storms and torrential
rains coming. But (4) geo-cachers were not wavering at this
Waypoint. Weather did not stall their descent into a dark, dank underground
tunnel with Mystery on their minds.

Motolsk&yacute; Brook entrance is not ominous on a sunny day. But take a look at THIS image
of the tunnel. In a rainstorm, would YOU walk down THAT surging creek and
disappear into THAT dark hole?

Knowing that they did just that, Can you suppose these four are innocent of
terminal stupidity?

<B>"If rains, no drains."</B>

The safety motto was ignored. While they prowled underground seeking
geo Souvenir, a large wave&mdash;<em>a gigantic wave</em> surged through the
channel and washed two survivors all the way to the Vltava River near
Prague!

Two lucky-duck Geo-seekers were somehow saved from a tragic fate. But two
were less fortunate. The 27-year-old female was discovered beneath the
Jirasek Bridge, drowned. A fourth male member of the party has, sadly,
not been located. For them, folly led to fatality.

Complicating the search for the missing body is the fact that mobile is
hopeless in the underground channel. Soil blocks signal, and there are no
transmitters installed in the culvert to carry the signal.
