(15 February 2005, Rushinga, Zimbabwe) The elephants were trampling
Christian's maize field, which he had planted on an elephant trail of long
standing. He had to find a way to fight back!	Fortunately, there was an
old minefield nearby, on the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border. Christian figured
a few landmines planted around his field would soon teach the elephants a
lesson they would never forget.

Christian may have gotten the idea of using the mines from a couple of
incidents that had recently transpired.	 A local resident had been injured
after picking up a landmine while herding cattle the week before. A week
before that, another Rushinga man had lost part of his leg after stepping
on a landmine.	The other villagers saw the writing on the wall, and
avoided the landmines.

But Christian realized they were just what he needed. Clearly, these mines
could cause great damage to an elephant! He dug up five that had been
exposed by recent heavy rains.	As he carried them home, the unstable mines
detonated, killing Christian instantly.

Then total number of elephants injured?	 Zero.	<!-- Christian Munetsi -->
