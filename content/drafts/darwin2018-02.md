(30 January 2018, Gaza)

A sexagenarian was examining his personal weapon in his home when he
inadvertently discharged it into his face! Twenty-one days after
accidentally shooting himself, Abu Hamam, 62, succumbed to the
self-inflicted head-bang and died clutching a Darwin Award. But, who is Abu
Hamam?

Abu is known to the world as Imad al-Alami, a founding member of Hamas, a
militant group that has been the de facto governing authority of the Gaza
Strip since 2007. Mr Alami served as Hamas' main envoy to Iran, a military
and financial backer, during several wars with Israel. Although declared a
specially designated global terrorist by the United States, in recent years
Abu Hamam was a key negotiator in Hamas ceasefire talks with Israel, and in
the 2011 release of a captured Israeli soldier.

"Hamas was Abu Hamam and Abu Hamam was Hamas," said Hamas Politburo Chief
Haniyeh. One would assume that a senior member of Hamas knows how to
handle a gun--yet Abu's incautious "personal weapons inspection" was
unexpectedly daft. This Darwin Award's for you, Mr. Alami.
