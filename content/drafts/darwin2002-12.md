(31 March 2002, Bangladesh) Six highway robbers, who had apparently watched too many gangster movies, were caught in their own trap when they blocked a bypass with their car at midnight. The driver of an oncoming truck carrying a cargo of cows was unable to halt his heavy vehicle in time. The truck rolled right through the blockade, crushing the car and its scheming occupants. Five dacoits died, and the sixth was critically wounded.

A cow was also killed in the accident. <!-- Mokammel Hossain, 30, Muktel Ali, 28, Bablu Miah, 26, and Idris Ali, of Sirajganj district; Ismail Hossain, 30, of Dhaka's Mirpur area -->
