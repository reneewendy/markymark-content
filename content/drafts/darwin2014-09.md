(18 February 2014, United Kingdom) Scott McKimmie's purple Volkswagen
Cabriolet would not be considered roadworthy by most people, but to a handy
mechanic a flaw can be considered a security feature. Early on Tuesday
morning outside The Phoenix pub in Corby, the 39-year-old started the 1998
Cabriolet in his usual unusual way -- he put the car in gear and
reached beneath the hood (the 'bonnet') and touched two wires together to
create an ignition spark.

Unfortunately Scott failed to remember that he had not set the
handbrake. To make matters worse he had modified the purple VW to run with
a fast idle to prevent stalling. As black wire touched red wire the engine
turned over and started, and the car lurched forward and knocked him
over. Due to the fast idle the vehicle continued on its merry way,
inflicting 36 "separate injuries" on the unfortunate man as -- like the
<A href="http://batteriesandbutter.com/blog/2013/04/history-energizer-bunny/">Duracell/Energizer bunny</A> -- it kept going and going.

As demonstrated in a police investigation video shown to the court, the engine modifications allowed the car to move forward without stalling when it was in first, second or third gear! Coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of accidental death with this summary: "It is quite clear that the cause of this tragedy was the unusual starting method Mr. McKimmie used to start his car."
