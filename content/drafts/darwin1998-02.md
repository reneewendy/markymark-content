		 <P align="left">(29 January 1998, Ohio) Hungry or just
		 plain stupid?	 Wednesday was a fateful day for
		 Michael. He was shooting the breeze with a group of
		 buddies, watching a friend clean his fish tank, when the
		 friend complained that one specimen in particular had
		 become a fishy menace. It had outgrown the tank, and was
		 eating other denizens of the aquatic community.
		

		 Michael volunteered to assist. He seized the five-inch
		 fish and attempted to swallow it. Unfortunately, the fish
		 continued its predatory ways by sticking in his craw. As
		 he gasped futilely for breath, turned blue, and sank to
		 his knees, his three friends realized that something was
		 amiss. They phoned 911 and informed the dispatcher that
		 Michael had eaten some fish, and was having trouble
		 breathing.
		

		 Paramedics were quickly dispatched, and they arrived to
		 find the fish tail still protruding from the victim's
		 mouth. Despite their best efforts neither the fish nor
		 the twenty-three-year-old could be resuscitated. The
		 killer fish had claimed one last victim.
		

		 "If I dare you to jump off a bridge and you do it, you're
		 stupid," Police Major Mike Matulavich said. Apparently
		 Michael was not a victim, he was just another Darwin
		 Awards contender.<!-- Michael Gentner -->
