		 Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows
		 in a downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane
		 of glass with his shoulder and plunged twenty-four floors
		 to his death. A police spokesman said Garry, thirty-nine,
		 fell into the courtyard of the Toronto Dominion Bank
		 Tower as he was explaining the strength of the building's
		 windows to visiting law students. Garry had previously
		 conducted the demonstration of window strength without
		 mishap, according to police reports. The managing partner
		 of the law firm that employed the deceased told the
		 Toronto Sun newspaper that Garry was "one of the best and
		 brightest" members of the two-hundred-man
		 association.</P>
