The man was entering a lift with two work mates when he accidentally dropped his key ring. He asked his mates to hold the lift while he climbed out to retrieve it. He exited via the ceiling trapdoor, and was scrambling down the side of the lift when an adjacent car began to move. It wedged him so firmly against the lift wall that it took police rescuers 3 hours to extract the crushed man, and additional two minutes to retrieve his keys.

And while opening the door usually triggers a safety shutdown on the car, it is unlikely to operate on the adjacent cars. on the The technical aspects of this story are valid.
