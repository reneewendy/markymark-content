(3 February 2008, California) Two dirtbikes, two drivers, two passengers.
Zero helmets, zero headlights, and a new moon.	Four friends were tearing
around on private land, where helmets and lights are not required. The
Highway Patrol said the two couples were killed when their bikes collided
between 1:30 and 3:30 AM in Modesto.

Emergency room workers have a name for people who ride dirtbikes without a
helmet. They're called 'Future Organ Donors' and that is the only career
now possible for Thomas, 33, Michael, 33, Kelly, 30, and Cynthia, 29.
