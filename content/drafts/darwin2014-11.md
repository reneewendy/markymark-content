jinja-title: Banana Bandido


jinja-confirmed:

jinja-status: draft
(27 June 2014, Costa Rica) A banana plantation was the setting for a Friday
evening robbery in Lim&oacute;n. Villegas, 30, lived (note past tense) in
the same building as the farm's cafeteria before his fatal slip-up. He was
in the process of breaking into the cafeteria via the roof when a security
guard heard suspicious noises and fired his 12-gauge shotgun toward the
rustling sounds.

A shotgun fires shells that contain several small, round projectiles called
shot. 12-gauge shotguns such as those used by Banana Security are large
weapons likely to be loaded with buckshot rather than birdshot, and
buckshot can kill or seriously damage a human body. However the intruder
or intruders were not immobilized and the warning shot was answered with
return fire, causing the security officer to take refuge behind a wall and
fire again! Thud, someone hit the ground! Another shot from the bandido or
bandidos!

All this commotion on the roof of Banana Farm Caf&eacute; seems outlandish
to me, but I suppose bananas are big business in Lim&oacute;n. When the
dust cleared two robbers were still standing, and a third robber was
discovered lying dead two hundred yards away. That man was Villegas.

The big surprise came when they turned over Villegas and realized that the
fatal wound--a shot to his buttocks--was caused by his own handmade weapon!
(What an ass hole.) So you see, dear readers, crime pays and D-I-Y guns
also pay, in spades.
