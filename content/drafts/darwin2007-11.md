(12 September 2007, Florida) A woman wins two concert tickets from a local
radio station. The Dave Matthews Band, live! She can't believe her luck.
She invites her friend to join her, but they are in for more than a concert
experience.

Flash forward to the next morning. My buddy, head of operations at the
amphitheater, looks like hell. He tells me that two women were killed the
previous night at the concert. I am shocked. Nothing like this has ever
happened at the amphitheater. I ask for details.

Flash back to the previous evening, 8:30pm and pouring rain. The show is
delayed. Two women leave the venue to escape the rain. They pass multiple
free shuttle buses that run directly to the parking lot. Instead, they opt
for a shortcut across a 7-lane Interstate.

They run a hundred yards through wet grass and jump a six-foot fence that
borders the road. Ahead are 3 lanes of freeway traffic, a 100' median, and
another 4 lanes of traffic. Beyond that is another six-foot fence, the
maze of an 'under construction' garage, and a long hike around a
casino.

All in all, the 'shortcut' to their vehicle covers a distance of half a
mile. And the women are in a torrential thunderstorm.	Free shuttle bus,
or mad dash across dangerous territory?

My buddy was an eyewitness when the first vehicle struck the women at 8:30
pm. Oddly, this was in the first lane of traffic, on a straightaway where
one can see headlights for miles in either direction. The impact hurled
the women farther into traffic, and each was struck by a second car. They
did not survive the collisions.

Ironically, one of the women was an "energetic and gifted athlete" who won
two national championships in gymnastics. Physical prowess is no
substitute for the homespun maxim:

<I>"Stop. Look. Listen. Or tomorrow you'll be missing."</I>
