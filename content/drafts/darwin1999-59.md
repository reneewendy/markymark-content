(20 October 1999, Texas)
A 21-year-old man died from shrapnel wounds when he and his friends discovered and began shooting at two explosive devices. The three men found the 75-millimeter "ceremonial military rounds" while cleaning out a building. Someone came up with the bright idea to trigger the explosives with gunfire fire, and you know what? It worked. <!-- Brandon Heath Strickland --> One man died at the scene, and the remaining two stepped aside to let the Fort Hood Bomb Disposal Unit do their job.
