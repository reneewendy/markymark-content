(20 June 2007, South Carolina) A passing cabbie found a 21 year-old couple
naked and injured in the road an hour before sunrise. The two people died
at the nearest hospital without regaining consciousness. Authorities were
at a loss to explain what had happened.	 There were no witnesses, no trace
of clothing, and no wrecked cars or motorcycles.

Investigators eventually found a clue high on the roof of a nearby
building: two sets of neatly folded clothes. Safe sex takes on a whole new
meaning when you are perched on the edge of a pyramid-shaped metal roof.
"It appears as if [they] accidentally fell off the roof," Sgt. Florence
McCants said.

This is a true Darwin Award trifecta: TWO people die, WHILE in the act of
procreation, due to an ASTONISHINGLY poor decision. Bottom line: If you
put yourself in a precarious "position" at the edge of a pointy roof, you
may well find yourself Falling in Love at the same time.

Ironically, one of the deceased was named "Tumbleston."<BR>
(<FONT size=-1>Some reports list the name as "Tubleston."</FONT>)

<I><B>trifecta</B>: a wager on the first three finishers <BR>
of a race, in the correct order.</I>
