(18 July 2004, Washington) Michael, 27, was spending a pleasant afternoon
cruising on his motorcycle. But witnesses who saw him speeding down
Meridian Avenue were not surprised when state troopers reported that he had
lost control near the Kapowsin Highway. You see, he was steering with his
feet. Michael was killed instantly after being thrown from his motorcycle,
which had veered to the right and hit a guardrail.
