(March 2017, England) What's that smell? A burglar removed a few roofing
shingles and climbed into the roof of a chemist shop in Queensbury. On his
way down, the man became stuck and was strangled by his own clothes. The
asphyxiated pill seeker was found several weeks later and well into
decomposition.
