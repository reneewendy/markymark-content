(10 April 1999, New York) Perhaps, as people get older, some folks really should retire from their
careers, or so it would seem for one 55-year old burglar. You see, Terrence <!-- Terrence Adams --> found new meaning in the term "Hanging around late at the bar" when he never returned home one night. It turned out that he was actually trying to break through the roof's window of a shop,
</TD><TD>
called the Dum Dum Boutique -- a catchy name for a clothing shop -- by bending back bars on the window. From this vantage point, he made a commanding move, and jumped into the store through this hole. Unfortunately, his sweater apparently didn't like all that fashion, and, refusing to join him, caught on one of the bent bars, which subsequently strangled him to death. He was found dead at the scene on Saturday morning.

In honor of his misadventure, residents of the Flatbush neighborhood have suggested that the Dum Dum Boutique be renamed the Dumb Dumb Boutique. -->
