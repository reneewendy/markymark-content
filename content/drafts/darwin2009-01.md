(5 February 2009, India) Bachelor lottery agent Pravin Kuse lived with his
brother's family in Vasai. His own house, an abandoned 100-year-old
building, was located a few meters away.

Some legends hold that a pot of gold lies buried at the end of the rainbow,
but Pravin learned in a dream that an ancient pot of gold was actually
buried beneath his house. He decided to follow his dream and dig for that
gold. He kept his plans private, to avoid a fight over the fortune.

The dream told him to dig beneath the staircase so after lunch, every day
without fail, Pravin would take his spade and dig a little deeper beneath the
stairs.	 The neighbors had no idea that days and nights of digging had
resulted in a fifteen-foot deep tunnel.	 The innovative gold-digger had
even rigged a remote-control toy car to carry a flashlight to assist him in
the dark.

He was smart enough to control his lighting needs, but not smart enough to
take into account the water table. One day the 32-year-old lottery agent
did not return home, and his worried relatives lodged a missing persons
report.	 Police discovered that the floor of the old house had caved in.
The soil beneath the staircase becomes wet at a depth of 15 feet due to its
proximity to the sea, and the unsupported walls of the tunnel had
collapsed.

A few hours later an earthmover had excavated Pravin's body from the debris,
along with a spade and the innovative mobile flashlight. The lottery
agent's number... was up.

(5 February 2009, India) For lottery agent Pravin Kuse, his number was up when he followed his dream and decided to dig for a pot of gold. A bachelor, Kuse, 32, lived with his brother's family in Vasai, India. According to his aged mother, Kuse had learned in a dream that an ancient pot of gold was buried beneath his abandoned 100-year-old house, located a few meters from his current residence. He warned his mother not to tell anyone about the dream, fearing that it would result in a fight over the fortune.

Some legends hold that a pot of gold lies at the end of the rainbow. But Kuse's dream told him to dig beneath the staircase of the old house. After lunch, every day without fail, Kuse would take his spade and dig a few meters further beneath the stairs.. This innovative gold-digger had even purchased a toy car and attached a flashlight to it to assist him while digging in the dark. The neighbors had no idea that days and nights of digging had resulted in a 15-foot deep tunnel.

One day Kuse did not return home. His worried relatives lodged a missing persons complaint and police were dispatched to the old house. Within a few hours, an earthmover had excavated Kuse's body from the debris. At a depth of 15 feet, the soil becomes moist due to its proximity to the sea. and it was determined that the floor of the house had caved in over Kuse. Authorities registered a case of accidental death and recovered the spade and the innovative mobile flashlight from the site.

In searching for a pot of gold, Kuse may not have had the luck of the Irish, but he does have the distinction of winning a Darwin Award.

NOTE: If you're going to search for a pot of gold, 'tis better to follow a legend than a dream. Irish folklore holds that a leprechaun keeps his fortune in a pot of gold and must give it anyone who follows the correct procedure. If you are feeling lucky, here's how to get it:

** Listen for the sound of a hammer. Leprechauns often keep busy by making a shoe for an elf.

** Sneak up on the leprechaun. He will be absorbed in his work and will not hear you.

** Hold on to the leprechaun, hold tight and don't let go.

** Keep your eyes on the leprechaun. He will do anything to get you to look away for a second, and if you do, he will disappear into the mist.

** Threaten him if he resists telling you where his pot of gold is hiding.

** Make the leprechaun take you to his pot of gold. You will find it at the end of the rainbow.
