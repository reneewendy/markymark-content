jinja-title: Self-Demolition Derby


jinja-confirmed:
jinja-status: draft
(September 2003, Minnesota) The purpose of a demolition derby is to smash
into other cars. Crash, repair, repeat. As a result, in competition,
derby cars become more fragile than the average car. So you would think
that Scot, a car owner, would take this fact into account when he crawled
under his derby car for repairs. "Why take the time to put a car up on
blocks?" He must have thought it would be faster and easier to use a handy
Bobcat-type skid loader, and just lift the car up from its bumper.

When the car was raised, Scot slid beneath. Then the bumper broke off.
Help was immediately summoned, but it was too late. Scot had lost his
final demolition derby.
