(1 January 2002, Brazil) The game of Russian Roulette, long a breeding
ground for natural selection, was improved upon by two men with a unique
approach to self-destruction.

On New Year's Eve, Antonio and his friend were befogged by Pinga, a
traditional Brazilian liquor, when they began playing a Russian Roulette
variant using holiday fireworks. Their version of the game consisted of
placing fireworks in their mouths, then lighting the fuses and competing to
see who would delay longest before spitting out the firework.

The man, dare we call him "winner," who discarded the explosive closest
to the point of detonation was the victor of this battle of wills.

Their blatant disregard for personal safety was matched only by their
foolish bravery. Antonio was our winner, holding one of the fireworks in
his mouth a bit too long, and thereby thereby earning praise for his
"courage" at his funeral.<!-- Antonio Silva and Jose Oliveira --></P>
