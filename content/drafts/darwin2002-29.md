(29 August 2002, Washington) An innovative petty crime spree turned into a
Darwinian opportunity when a Vancouver man fell out of a minivan while
throwing rocks. Five men had been denting mailboxes and moving cars with
their low-tech missiles, when 23-year-old John decided he needed a wider
range of targets, As the Ford Aerostar cruised through a residential
neighborhood, he left his compatriots at the windows while he opened the
sliding door. One mighty throw later, he pitched through the opening,
struck his head on the pavement, and suffered the ultimate penalty for his
crime: stone cold death.
