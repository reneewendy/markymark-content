(26 February 2008, France) A 71-year-old pensioner met a shocking end
when his frugal attempt to illuminate his yard with power siphoned
from the National Grid backfired spectacularly.

The gentleman in question illegally opened a major power junction box at
the front of his house, intending to hard-wire a cable to his garden shed.
Unfortunately, he attempted to do this rewiring during a major downpour.
The result was all too predictable. The poor chap was immediately deep
fried, and declared a Darwin Award at the scene.

Lessons:<BR>
1--Don't wire your shed to a local power substation.<BR>
2--Don't wire your shed to a power substation... in the rain.<BR>
3--There <I>is</I> such a thing as being <I>too frugal.</I>
