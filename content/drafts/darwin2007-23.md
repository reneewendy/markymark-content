(25 March 2007, Oregon) Anthony was stopped for speeding. The 20-year-old
was driving a vehicle that checked out as stolen in Idaho. The deputy
called for backup, and placed the suspect in a patrol car. Here, Anthony
had his first great idea! He thought he could outsmart the police, a
notion that often proves harmful to the perp.

While the officers had their backs turned, Anthony managed to move his
handcuffed hands from behind to in front of his body. His second great
idea was to wiggle through the small window to the front seat of the patrol
car. His third great idea? He drove off in the patrol car, nevermind the
State Police officers and deputies from two counties.

Naturally, Anthony wished to elude pursuit. He did so by driving 90 mph,
passing some cars and forcing others off the road. He was rapidly
approaching the city of Lakeview when he encountered spike strips placed in
his way by the police.	But not even the setback of flat tires slowed him
down. He could still control the disabled car and outrun the police!

We will never know what he might have done if he had reached Lakeview.
Just before he reached town, a state policeman following standard procedure
rammed the rear quarter panel of the stolen police cruiser, a move designed
to spin and slow the car. But due to the flat tire and Anthony's erratic
driving, the vehicle spun off the road and rolled.

Anthony's final mistake? He had neglected to fasten his seat belt. He was
thrown from the car, and died a week later. Whether or not he managed to
learn anything during that final week of reflection, one hopes that others
will.

<B>Jeff Shultz says,</B> "My friend and Army Reserve co-worker confirms
this story. He is in the Oregon State Police (not State Patrol.) He said,
"An Oregon State Police Trooper <!-- Sgt. Steve Yates --> performed the PIT
maneuver and rolled the guy. He had no choice in the matter. [The
perpetrator] had already proven he had no thoughts of safety for other
people at all. The state trooper rolled him just before he made it into
town. The only error is that he is with the State Police, not State
Patrol.'" Jan-2010<BR>
<B>Darwin says, Thanks for the confirmation, Jeff.</B>
