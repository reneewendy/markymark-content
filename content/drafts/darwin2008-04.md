Snowmobiles and alcohol are a dangerous mix. Then came the rabbit.

After a day spent partying and racing snowmobiles in the wilderness, a
group of snowmobilers were headed back to their cabin, when up popped a
jackrabbit! They gave chase. Several collisions were narrowly
averted, and so all the snowmobiles backed off... except one.

This snowmobiler kept his eye on the quarry and rapidly closed in. The
rabbit darted aside to save itself. The snowmobiler closed in again. The
rabbit ran toward the road, where there was less snow. Trying to ram his
rabbit before it crossed the road, the man accelerated to Mach 1.

But the rabbit had other ideas. It darted into the culvert beneath the
road. Witnesses stated that the snowmobiler never even braked. There was a
metallic crunch as the accelerating vehicle rammed into the culvert,
followed by a blast that shattered the snowmobile into a thousand bits.

This brand of snowmobile had a fuel tank mounted in front. The culvert
admitted the tip of the snowmobile, then cut into the cowling, spilling
fuel over the hot engine. The body of the snowmobiler was blown twenty feet
back into the field.

The rabbit's whereabouts was unknown.
