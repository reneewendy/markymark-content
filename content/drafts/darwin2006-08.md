<I>"One string short of a kite."</I>

(19 March 2006, Belize) Benjamin Franklin reputedly flew his kite in a
lightning storm, and discovered that lightning equals electricity.
However, certain precautions must be taken to avoid sudden electrocution.
Kennon, 26, replicated the conditions of Ben Franklin's experiment, but
without Ben's sensible safety precautions.

Kennon was flying a kite with a short string that he had extended with a
length of <I>thin copper wire.</I> The copper made contact with a
high-tension line, sending a terminal bolt of electrical "lightning"
sizzling towards the man.

Just bad luck?	Not according to Kennon's father, who said his son was an
electrician and "should have known better."
