<!-- Andreas Plack, 23 -->
(January 2002, Italy) A violent attack on an innocent man? Andreas, a 23-year-old ex-bouncer from Italy, was found lying in a pool of blood near a country road. Police initially mistook him for a victim of sadistic mutilation. His left leg had been nearly severed by a chainsaw. His last act was an emergency call to operators who heard only a "death rattle." By the time help arrived, copious bleeding had drained his body of blood.
		<P>
Sad plight? Not quite.The incredible truth was far odder.

		<P>
Andreas had conspired with his cousin in an insurance scam. The 29-year-old accomplice confessed that he was the &quot;assailant&quot; who attacked--and inadvertently killed--the younger man in a mutually planned insurance fraud that went badly awry.

		<P>
Andreas had convinced his cousin to cut his left leg off with a chainsaw in order to reap nearly a million dollars from numerous insurance policies. Permanent disability was all that was required. Andreas relied on his cunning, and his knowledge of first aid, to survive the chainsaw incident.
		<P>
The attack took place near a country lay-by. The cousin sawed Andreas' leg below the knee, and severed a major artery	in a gambit timed too close for survival. Emergency crews arrived to find Andreas dead and his cousin fled, tossing the chainsaw in a river on the way out of town.
		<P>
The cousin now languishes in a cell on homicide charges.
		Andreas' death was a classic example of fate noticing those who buy chain&nbsp;saws.
