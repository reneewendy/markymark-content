<IMG src="/i/darwin1994-11.gif" border=0 align=right>(February 1982,
Arizona) Desert marksmen aim their weapons at Saguaro cacti so frequently
that Arizona was forced to declare the "sport" a felony. Offenders risk a
$100,000 fine and three years in prison. But that doesn't stop
sharpshooters like 27-year-old David, who was trying to impress friends
when he opened fire on a Saguaro in 1982.

He was killed when it fell on him.

He reportedly fired two slugs from a 16-gauge shotgun at a 27-foot cactus,
and began to shout, "Timber!" He only had enough time to utter the first
syllable before a 23-foot section of the prickly plant fell and crushed him
beneath its spiky skin.<!-- David M. Grundman of 3932 W. Kaler Drive -->

<I>This story was confirmed by a caller to RAdio-Free Wease in Rochester,
NY, who swore it happened "years ago" when he lived in Arizona. He placed a
call to the Arizona Republic and the operator connected us to editor Tamara
Thornton, who clearly rememberd the incident, but said it happened "like
fifteen years ago." </I>
