<!-- DONE -->

(12 April 2008, Florida) Traffic was moving slowly on southbound
I-95. Shawn M. had recently left a Pompano Beach bar, and now he was stuck
in traffic. As the saying goes, you don't buy beer--you just rent it, and
Shawn couldn't wait another moment to relieve himself. "I need to take a
leak," he told his friends.

Traffic was deadlocked, so the waterlogged man climbed out, put his hand on
the divider, and jumped over the low concrete wall... only to fall 65 feet
to his death. "He probably thought there was a road, but there wasn't,"
said a Fort Lauderdale police spokesman. The car was idling on an overpass
above the railroad lines.

<B>His mother</B> shared her thoughts. "Shawn didn't do a whole lot
for a living. He got along on his charm, just like his father."

Though his death was tragic, Shawn's downfall proves the old adage: <I>Look
before you leak!</I>

"Guess he was dying to go."<BR>
"He shoulda peed in a bottle."<BR>
"Apparently it was just his time to go."<BR>
