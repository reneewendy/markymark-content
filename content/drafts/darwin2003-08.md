(17 February 2003, New York) A 25-year-old man, long accustomed to annoying
neighbors by snowmobiling at high speeds through sleeping streets, finally
received his comeuppance -- and in the process, a Darwinian nomination --
when he drove headfirst into a tree.

It is not only his reckless speeding through a nighttime residential area
that makes him eligible; nor is it merely because he was driving an
unregistered, uninsured snowmobile without a helmet while drunk. Although
these spectacularly stupid ideas were ultimately responsible for his
demise, there is yet another relevant aspect to report.

Brian "The Brain" was a fireman, a member of the same company dispatched to
peel him off the tree, the same organization that preaches snowmobile
safety; responds to other gruesome, drunken snowmobile "accidents, and the
very same company that posts an illuminated "helmet safety" notice 700 feet
from his own home.

Clearly, while others have been as foolish as Brian in their choice of
recreational activities, few have been so uniquely aware of the possible
repercussions prior to making that choice! <!-- Brian Sabinsky, 25, of Loch
Sheldrake, NY -->
